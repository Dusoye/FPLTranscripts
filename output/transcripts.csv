[Music] same Let me refresh [Music] [Music] hello everyone and welcome to the FPL armad I'm Chris Kieran is here as usual hello how you doing hello yeah not too bad thank you yourself yeah I'm all right all right ready for game week two um chitchat about that tonight talking points from game week one obviously your juicy might score and um could have been better if I just captained the right player but you know I know I know but you know we again should we we start there do you want to talk about your your team that no harand team uh yeah so I did end up going with that route with the no Holland route and yeah I was pretty happy with it in the end um got 79 points um yeah gave me rank of 380k soly that's where I am overall which is obviously a decent start um yeah so pretty much full full clean sheets at the back um with Trent on eight sver on six Hall on five got a Yellow Card unfortunately um obviously little bit lucky to keep the cleen sheet but it did come off around the 70ish mark which is obviously good for clean sheets yeah um Pedro porro should really be not be conceding to Leicester they looked terrible um so should have probably got like a 13 point or 12 point or something like that but yeah nine points will do um yeah went with J went with Salah um went with Bruno Bruno in the end disappointing but yeah should have HED as well unlucky um and then sacker as well in the Midfield um yeah proving to good points there too um and then yeah just went for the wrong captain and isach um yeah unfortunate and um yeah sanky up top uh kind of a bit unlucky like he probably got a bit crowded out most of the time I think he just got marked a lot there so I don't know hopefully that doesn't really continue and hope he gets more chances but yeah other than that um Barco not showing up which is a bit of concern um and then Jefferson my third sort of oh yeah fter on the bench did get some minutes which is quite nice see yeah all looking good for next week other than um porro but I think he'll probably be fine yeah Barco might get sold as well I heard I think it's supposed to be alone but yeah interesting um it is I don't know I thought about isach as well like we were so set on it like all preseason isack Captain seemed obvious and you know perhaps it would have been better if they hadn't got someone sent off but yeah Salah Salah away at a promoter side and sacker against wolves who had look put poor in preseason as well I don't know difficult e in hindsight but it was home team yeah another promoted team like Newcastle been looking good like it did make sense to me anyway yeah it did all right um you know similar really um apart from salaa Harland and no yot so yeah maybe that's our main differences actually so um celra and porro like everyone else um harand is lanky up front in Midfield I've got Smith rosaka e and Fernandez like you I felt a bit disappointed with Bruno missing those two big chances e looked like he was at the center of everything and had that goal ruled out and I think he hit the post another time so I think he was he was a bit unlucky to blank um and obviously Konza is is just like don't know shocker really I watched watched the game he seemed to be doing quite well because you know when you own a player he seem to be doing fairly okay for first half like he's so close to connec him with a cross for like a Trent assist his goal and then yeah he got subbed at halim and yeah I didn't really see it coming I thought slot was quite harsh on him afterwards as well saying he was losing too many like balls but I didn't think he was too bad anyway it seems like a lot of people have rushed to get rid of him because he's dropping in price but there's no guarantee one he's even out of the team like moving forward he was still started ahead of canate all preseason and that first game mhm so so there's no guarantee there and I and I think it's quite strange that people have I don't know not got enough backup is if he is out really so yeah we'll see I'm looking forward to this week obviously it was painful not having Salah or any Liverpool attack which is basically where this the first game week went so we'll see if harand can bring the balance but I think this is going to happen all season like the the Liverpool V City captaincy and yeah what you can do with the rest of it so no I I quite like it's made the season a bit more varied for sure H yeah you you'll probably end up um getting those points back this week and maybe more I don't know it's yeah I hope so because it it which did look poor second half they started well and then they just got legging Liverpool created loads of chances in that second half and really Trent could have got like a couple of assists for that y chance he's like my my biggest I need him like Salah I feel like can be covered by sacka almost for quite a lot less but not having Trent is looking like a bit of a an oversight really because he just look so creative maybe that was partly due to twitch but yeah he L he looked good he he'll get a lot of chances against frenford for sure as well I think he will I think he will all right well let's um start with the preview talking about a few matches do you want to we talked about City and and Harland I think he's probably the biggest talking point because it looks like a it could be a big win but you know nothing's ever certain in football um yeah so I don't know I'll ask you a question first um Trevor Captain are you considering it you know I was reading quite a lot of analysis actually of expected points essentially and I think this is the biggest expected points Harlem will get all season because he's playing the team that Pro got well maybe it should be Southampton actually but for some reason it's I witch but the basically the one of the worst promoted sides at home against the the best team so his expected points for this weekend is probably as high as it's going to be all season we obviously think we're only going to get two double game weeks this season because of all the FA Cup Thing FA Cup rearrangements so people have floated the idea that in the the double game weeks you might play your free hit you might play your bench boost and maybe you'd want to use your triple captain in a single game week personally I probably don't I think it's too early for me to use it because I don't feel there's enough data there about how good City are how bad it switch are and I I think I don't know I just feel like it might it though people will go for it yeah I think they will like it's it's early when there's no Champions League rotation to worry about like you know because there's like eight group stage games for that as well now so there's like even more games to play in that so he's you know injury free right now no no worries him not playing 90 minutes um and yeah like I said so well okay so he got 17 touches versus Chelsea which is obviously very poor but um you know a lot for Harland well yeah maybe um he got two shots on target one goal um the other one was was pretty good pretty good save by Sanchez as well so um yeah he had 0.28 XG or so I mean that's okay after obviously a small samp size but you know um yeah so going on like sort of the defensive numbers from it witch which is the most Waring thing is like a non- Holland owner um 18 shots conceded in one game the 19 of all teams obviously this is against Liverpool so this is um going to be a little bit higher than probably average but six big chances conceded as well which was 20th of all teams and then a 2.68 XGC conceded which is 20th of all teams as well so yeah um You' probably think you know City attack is probably just slightly ahead of the pools in general you'd think so um yeah there's I've got to have the biggest over in the world to hide behind I think for this game like I will probably be um not watching it hopefully it's like a 3:00 game not watching um turn off the notifications for that and and um yeah hopefully I can come out the other side with um maybe I'm just getting one or something and that that would be fine yeah I can just deal with that um yeah so um the I was the I was the exact same for the Liverpool game I was and I think that's what it's going to be like when you don't own the other one I was thinking about I'm going to need the big sofa for Salah and to be honest first half he was like pretty quiet and they didn't and restricted him and then as soon as they I don't know stepped off a little bit in the second half he just punished them and he was brutal so yeah maybe it'll be the the same here I hope yeah they they just seem to I don't know hit a wall at half time I don't really know what happened they just um yeah or Liverpool just stepped it up I guess an an a slot just ripped into them half time I guess and you know made those chances probably ripped into quanser and everyone else was probably a bit scared and then they just went out and and got the easy win I guess in the end um but yeah City defensive wise I think they were a little bit fortunate to keep clean sheet against Chelsea due to sort of Jackson's incompetence of just not staying on side when he can see the all of the Defenders down the line um really poor from him but yeah gavardo 6 million 32% owned now he wasn't very attacking basically at all um not sure remains to be seen if Walker comes back in for the the next game or or Le I guess people are looking at Lewis um yeah but yeah if Walker comes back in then maybe viol gets back to that attacking role but at the moment if Lewis is starting then it looks like V's gonna be further behind sort of them saying as sort of a back three at times um yeah but he did get one shot blocks which is obviously nothing um yeah early days didn't so he's probably not worth the money at the moment if he's not going to be attacking but like I said early days um hopefully that changes Walker's not going to stay B season um yeah so if Swit um themselves they had a 0.4 XG and got seven shots in so you know yeah that's not bad um so you know the defense against um City you know um yeah they could do something it would be nice if they take a clean sheet away from varol um that would be good in Edison owners and stuff like that so um I thought they were lucky last week so there's six points um that they shouldn't have got I think yeah they had some good chances in the like I say in the first half against Liverpool they created some like moments and maybe like threatened a few times so I feel like they're going to have a a chance on on the on the break but yeah I think it's it seems unlikely they're gonna they're going to score this weekend yeah I'll just mentioned that um the one big chance that they did get was from that Greaves the four Z Center back um 0.7% owned um and he's he's like super tall and that's where he got his head header from um which was probably about eight yards out something like that and just straight at Allison unfortunately um so I think he'll probably provide a route of goals for set pieces from for them if he's he should be nailed on um so I think four- Zer if you're looking for a barker replacement and stuff like that like he seems like he could be a decent option um yeah yeah and that fixtures are mixed and you know they're going to be like quite fairly strong at home so for yeah 4.0 he did look like he had a decent goal threat I think he yeah he seems like a good option as as well really sa 2.0 yeah exactly no gab so you've got I mean we'll probably talk more in depth about transfer plans a bit later but you know gundo is coming back to city um which is quite you know exciting for for them because he returns as like just you know been such an important player for them in the past and from an FPL point of view we know that he's like a proven asset in the past has done well so it's not like um was it s sylvinho is that right Savio Savio who came in and and almost a bit like doku as well who we've who had there last season as well like at least we've got like a bit of a guarantee with with G which is is kind of kind of good but I doubt he'll be um signed and ready involved this weekend but I kind of think that sort of thing gives him a bit of a lift as well I I I'm unsure if he'll be Lo like locked in to play there is R there is kovic like I don't think he's gonna be play playing 100% every week that's for sure no I I don't think so either but yeah he could be an option um but maybe maybe just in the game kind of like what marz used to be when there's games that you're just like you're sure he's going to start and and then if he plays in that sort of attacking sort of 810 roll then then he could he could be really good I think he'll probably come in around 7.5 million I think that seems fair for him yeah yeah no I think that could be good um all right should we move on and talk about um Liverpool sure actually maybe just before we get into this I wanted to talk about um bonus points a little bit because it's something that has been highlighted a bit over the weekend we talk about the changes I don't know what you thought about or noticed it much but I had some there were some interesting notes from um Baker FPL on onx who does the above ad rdge FPL podcast and he done some like analysis of both how the Defenders and forwards have been affected and I just wanted to take like some of his information and share just I thought it was quite interesting so this weekend gone there was six clean sheets compared to four in game week one of last year so you'd think based on that there'd be more bonus for Defenders but there wasn't there was 24 bonus awarded to Defenders last season and this season there was only 12 from six clean sheets and no Defender this weekend got Max bonus and yeah it looked like Trent was going to get it but he um it obviously got change later on he and he had and I would say as well from looking at I did a few numbers which I'll I'll read out now actually just before we go on to that bit he actually had three key passes and two big chances created which was was more I appreciate how Salah got two returns as well so obviously that favored it but typically a Defender getting that higher return would help and it was probably most noticeable in porro like last season if porro had scored a goal and they draw 1-1 absolutely no question that he would have got three bonus and he just squeaked one bonus I think with like five minutes to go of the game he was on no bonus and then he came back into it so and then in that game in particular a midfielder who I think I'm right in saying that he didn't get any attacking uh involvement uh let me just see if I can remind myself say yeah who did get three oh no it oh no sorry it was um fat what I've got him on the screen now so he got three and he all he got was one one assist for the V and it was like ball recoveries and shots so there was a huge huge change in that and on forwards this is where people were saying or baker said in his stats here this is the main thing to think about it really isn't four points for a goal anymore because eight Strikers scored this week so none of them break and every single one of them that scored got five bonus five of them got top bonus and that was 20 bonus from eight goals so each goal effectively was worth 2.5 points which you know bodess even better for Harem this weekend but the one to to like highlight which I thought was quite interesting was salanki who obviously as you and I know blanked this weekend he got like a baseline bonus of 17 for not doing anything and missed out on I'll see if I can bring it up on screen now missed up on missed out on bonus by you know probably about 10 points but any goal and he's absolutely getting Max bonus even if it had ended 1-1 so I think that something that definitely we need to consider this season is maybe 343 or 352 just to get as many goal scorers in the team or maybe even forwards because like the the amount you're scoring for one goal seems to be now roughly six rather than four I need to get rid of my f a up then basically well I it seems like it's going to be a better way to to generate points is what they're saying after one game we and maybe it'll be true but after two but yeah if any Striker goal is now essentially going to be worth roughly six which I think is quite a big change anyway so yeah something to to flag up really um all right let's move on and just talk about Liverpool game like I I mentioned so they had the six big chances at the weekend like you already mentioned really that was the most of all teams they got expected go gos this weekend of 3.3 against brenford so that's the second highest I think after City are on something like 3.5 or 3.6 so both of them are high this weekend brenford they I think they did okay this past weekend they had 1.1 expected goals conceded so they kept like in Brackets a good Crystal Palace team fairly restricted they only conceded one big chance and that was from 14 shots so that was either Palace shooting from poor places or being made to shoot from poor places I feel like Fen look shaky when I did watch it but yeah they the the eye test defensively I think they they looked a bit dodgy yeah yeah I think the fact that he made so many saves sort of aligns with the fact that yeah they were you know suspect in defense but he was able to bail them out all the shots were of poor quality and I don't think that'll happen against Liverpool I think Liverpool will punish them they've got expected goals ConEd of 0.9 against Liverpool so you would expect based on that that as a good chance Liverpool are going to keep a clean sheet and win by at least two or three goals which yeah I think is fair and still worrying as as a non Liverpool owner of anyone really um yeah I just I think it's I don't know what's what's happened to me to totally swerve Liverpool but anyway that's how how it is um so on on Trent he definitely passed the high test in the second half three key passes two big chances created and just eight points and that 8.2 expected points was the highest return of all defenders in game week one and but he's way down on on ownership and not ownership on transfers in this week I'm worried about he's going to get some price Rises because I think the earliest I can own Trent or ear earliest I will own Trent will be game week four when they've got back-to-back games against forest and bmer maybe going to dble double check yeah so that's the earliest time I think I can get on some players and you know it gives me three weeks to evalate who looks like the yeah picks there Salah obviously higher scoring mid after game week one four shots on the box was the second most of all mids in game one I think it was Moma who had um more than him what what did you think of like the Liverpool game obviously you're sat on Triple Liverpool and they do have they've got a decent fixture this week they've got that man united game and then they continue to have decent fixtures up until game week eight I suppose this kind of puts off the early wild card or is there any chance that Harland and City sort of scare you into changing your thinking there's obviously many chances of that happening but um yeah I thought they looked um fairly average in the first half and then they just stepped it up so if they can you know step it up on a whim like that at half times then then you know there's a good reason or a good suspicion that they're going to keep scoring points and jot looked good he missed that one really big chance as well um so there there was nearly more points for him nearly more points for Tris because that would have been an assist too um so yeah I'm I'm happy with the triple up for now um yeah I think it's probably going to be a clear Salah Captain for me this week because he's going to play the 90 minutes like I'd be tempted by but um yeah he's not going to play the 90 minutes is he so so sah I think is the only one only option I have there no I think it looks good and on the brenford side of things like I mentioned to you on Sunday when they played like if we knew the whole preseason that Tony was definitely Le leaving I think wo would have been such a yeah a pick he's owned by less than 5% we know last season he's clinical he's good for goals and assists and he's good for bonus points as well he had three key passes one big chance created uh one shot one goal obviously we'll be on penalties and brenford have got some fantastic fixtures coming up in six yeah game week six I think you were like mention it or du to mention it as well but yeah their fixtures game week six they got West Ham wolves back Tob back at home they got an away game against man united but then it's um ipswitch full and Bournemouth Everton Leicester so basically from 6 until 13 they've got let's say one fairly m game on on paper and yeah W and wiissa both look good actually those two are another good highlight of the bonus points so wiissa had um two shots in the Box one key pass didn't create any big chances had 47 Baseline bonus and got all bonus whereas moo got three key passes and one big chance created and only got the two so again it's it does seem like there's just obviously we're going to have more examples but definitely in this first weekend it's shown such a waiting towards strike on bonus which is good we to get better didn't you say he only had two shots right who moo two yeah so like where is he getting that 47 I thought it was from you were getting more bonus points accumulation from like shots on Target and stuff like that so like where is he getting all that baseline from um it's interesting yeah I don't know enough about all the metrics that combined to make bonus but you're right they would we basically were told the when the changes came out that it was going to be based on um yeah shots on target um I'm just trying to have a look yeah he had two he had two shots both in the Box one big chance is high XG for his goal obviously and yeah he scooped he didn't from a creative point of view he had not Point not one xxa so yeah he was he was definitely differed to wo yeah okay fair um all right and so yeah pretty much wraps up on the Liverpool Liverpool brenford chat I expect it to be a yeah an easy Liverpool win yeah I think just on those brenford guys like um I think it's just gonna be everyone's probably going to see that fixture swing and get on it so yeah I don't know if you want to go maybe a bit earlier but then the fixtures earlier are rough as boots so there Spurs decent time to go on it yeah game five one week early but before that like there's man four and then obviously this week is Liverpool away which doesn't sound great but I could see them scoring this week they certainly could H Southampton and three sounds pretty good though at home um yeah I think it pro it will be a good test for Liverpool because brenford have typically been like quite a decent mid-table side and they've been difficult for Liverpool before like I they've been difficult for city as well yeah I think they know how to play against big teams and when they get into like the sort of areas that ipswitch were getting into they'll have a bit more quality so whether that means any goals or not I don't know but they're definitely like a a decent side that Spurs game could actually be such a sleeper like Spurs was so bad defensively the other night in the second half and like people will probably look at that like I did initially and think that's not a good fixture but wrong I feel like they would be good in a away against Spurs in that game so yeah maybe even from game we five I think they're almost just as good as each other those two teams with Spurs and Redford um okay so let's move on to Villa Arsenal this week um yeah I in my current DFT that I sent you I've got CA benched which I think is um obviously a bit of a luxury um but I think I will actually end up sing that switching that and playing sber um and then benching Hall I think because yeah sha R card like their defense is a little bit depleted um but anyway so Arsenal yeah um uh yeah so what am I going to say arsenal was expected for the top yeah as expected basically for the GC numbers they were top 0.4 and they were only slightly beaten by Southampton on 0.3 that's yeah because of that red card and basically Newcastle barely attacked um so can they keep a clean sheet against Villa like obviously best numbers already in the first game week um I think it's risky obviously but I wasn't overly impressed with Villa like yeah their game despite the win like I didn't think they look particularly good um they got a 1.88 extra G which is pretty good with four teams 15 shots versus fourth and four big chances created which joint second so the numbers do say that they were quite good but I testwise I wasn't impressed um and then their expected goals conceded was high on Villa I just had a look 2.4 expected goals conceded against West Ham yeah that's huge so um yeah Arsenal attackers um yeah I'm happy to own zaka this week for sure um yeah obviously Villa went on such a huge run at home didn't they last year just winning basically every game so maybe that's a big difference but I guess we'll see coming this weekend um just on Watkins as well like um yeah 9 million 34% owned when I wrote the notes Terrible Day at the Office of him I got bad day but it was actually a terrible day like his no preseason minutes like it showed like not. no no XG not. no XA not Point not not xgi like not zero shots zero big chances zero C passes like he he didn't register on the the board like at all like he did literally nothing he he jogged around the London Stadium for like 62 minutes and just may as well have been a ghost like funny not funny that he's been maybe he's been given that extra time off and maybe it'll come come back to be good but yeah it was a bit strange well well we hope so obviously but um yeah just on the the signs of that like he was no in there like nothing at all like um I think if you owned him or started with him like he's obviously a little bit too early to get nervous about him like if you own him you definitely keep him uh so the game three to nine run is obviously amazing like he's got Leicester Everton wolves ipswitch man united Fulham and Bournemouth you know that's just as good as like the um the brenford one as you mentioned earlier um so that run looks insane a lot of people are going to look at him so let's see if he can start to pick up some hope hopefully not because I've got SBA so yeah it was close last season between these two like the managers haven't changed I didn't Villa win both didn't they I know they won one but I can't remember what was the other one was I feel like they won both with clean sheets as well yeah may I think so anyway yeah I think it's going to be a close game I'm for what it's worth I'm probably going to start CBA over um coner and quansa yes Fair I think you probably have to like well maybe not have to but it's not worth a one point sub I don't think CA could score yes yeah um so H hav I want to mention oh yeah like yeah so I was obviously pretty big on him pretty much all of preseason like I really wanted to start with him um and yeah anyone who did has obviously got rewarded um 12 points joint top forward um for points so far um obviously one game but yeah play the 90 minutes Jesus come on as I said over these last few prons Jesus came on he stays on the pitch full set of Subs happened and that again he stayed on the pitch when Jesus came on stuff so yeah he's 100% nailed it seems like um he got obviously 100% goal involvement with the goal and assist as well yeah same as sacker um .45 XG five shots ver his joint first of all forwards so yeah I've just got down here like what is there not to like about him honestly like couple seasons ago when Jesus came to Arsenal and he was the first CH Striker and he was eight million everyone wanted him he was he was in most teams like I I think we should start be to be looking at him as like the the player that we should be looking to get as a double up for Arsenal attackers um yeah with someone like slanky you could move on from him possibly get if you can get the 5.5 up to htz um yeah stri maybe yeah that too yeah and with stri getting loads of bonus as you said loads of points like he's he's doing things he's doing the goals you know so um yeah I think he'll probably do well this weekend as well same as sacka like I'm I'm excited they they just look like a great team I know I feel like that we've got some we've got some actual genuine Center forward options at Big teams because their prices are low like salani now at Spurs hav obviously at Arsenal and and Y even though being class of midfielder at the moment all three are playing Center forward and our first choice in are a good price and again to reiterate the point about the bonus sacka obviously one goal one assist and one big chance created havs one goal one assist no big chances created and havs one or got all three bonus points and had like six more Baseline bonus so yeah I think obviously he doesn't have the penalties over sacker but he's if he's still going to be getting that that extra point for yeah the goal he's he's definitely worth considering this season I think he do you think they've done that as well just to like level up between midfielders because they get the extra point for a clean sheet definitely yeah they must they must have like we we definitely well I've complained that Strikers like their worth isn't as good as midfields for ages I think everyone's felt like oh that's why ball recoveries would like annihilate the strikers as well so now it feels like the bonus on forwards is great like again with vardy the other night barely did anything in the game apart from his goal obviously like P perro got one but perro was way more involved more key passes and vard got two boners missed a missed a big chance as well which would normally be a big p penalized point so yeah it's it's really the more you look at each of the games of the the game week you sort of think about how yeah there is yeah I I think we need to um react rather than being too late on it to be honest and just just start to yeah I think you've already got three decent Strikers in there but like I I well once I've got a couple transfers locked in then then yeah I may be looking that way yeah need a third one yeah no I think it's really interesting how that's happened it'll definitely change the way the points come in um all right was any more to add on the Arsenal fixture uh no honestly um yeah um I'm a bit shocked that Alex Moreno has gone to Forest which I think is interesting um obviously he was a little bit behind Dena and Matson I suppose um but yeah so that's just another one that's gone to another team um and then Matson I just just waiting for him to start to get starts ahead OFA which he should and then he's going to be like a good option I think yeah definitely no I like him he looks like he's yeah he's probably will be First Choice quite easily all right um I'll talk briefly about I was trying to choose which game to to talk about and um I think man united Brighton's probably the the best one um of players who've got interesting assets basically so both teams kept a clean she in game week one both look far more sturdy than they did last season um Ro it's robot FPL um he shows the market odds basically for upcoming game weeks and they've basically had Manny night and bright both having 1.6 goals this weekend so it's it's you know it's not going to be high scoring but I think there's definitely players to to talk about so I think there's quite a lot of change happening in Brighton's forward line they've made a few signings but I think matoma and minty to an extent as well look really hot this season M looked great before he got subbed and been doing well in preseason just mention matoma because he's so you know he's not really been talked about anything think no he hasn't preseason everyone was talking about enu at at um 6.5 million but he's such a risk like when matoma has been in the league he has been good so he's been in the two seasons now and I think in that time he's got I think it's like 26 returns over two seasons he basically gets a return every other game so in under basically two different managers the third one now he got eight points this game week he had four shots in the Box two big chances I think 1.97 XG as well yeah it was it was high and it was it he played yeah from what I saw of it he played really well um he didn't get any bonus because he's not an attacker but he obviously got his clean sheet and his his goals but he's never been in that 6.5 million discussion people have got anuku and worried about starts I don't think you're have to worry about starts from matoma and he's and he's proven the fixtures are still a bit mixed for Brighton though because they've got Arsenal away after this game we which is unlike to to yield much but then back to back at home they got o switch and Forest in four and five and then Chelsea away and Spurs at home all good fixtures I think y we've got someone like uh we've both got Bruno I've got J um those two are both looking like Prime candidates to go down to someone like Mata definitely definitely yeah it's it's strange because yeah no one talked about him as you said um and he's he's nailed on he's he's basically one of the only players in that team to be nailed on other than maybe Duncan van he not even I was going to say the goalkeeper not even the goalkeeper is um so yeah what's not to like again like M should be Lo logged in but no he doesn't really have any challenge to that left left midr at all not really no I think they're trying to sign some players obviously to to come in there maybe when March is back but that's I mean they've got such a huge list of of players in their Midfield role but yeah M mat is by far and away clear left um left wing choice and yeah less than 5% ownership I I know already trying to think about future planning but brenford in gameweek six and Brighton in gameweek four there's some definitely some better players to have there if if Bruno or e or 6.5 inuko aren't aren't performing um and then just on Bruno just to talk about him 8.3 expected points was the second highest of all players in gameweek one I think that was highest after matoma um so he should have done a lot but missed those two big Chan yeah United has still got some decent fixtures but let's see um how he goes the next couple of couple of weeks he's he's highly owned so he's he's he did tweet he did say um sorry to all the F managers out there like he just said keep the fave or something like that so I liked that yeah and then and then finally just on um man united as a team basically Defenders could be on the watch list they kept this clean sheet against Fulham I thought they looked quite good in defense in the second half pretty strong and I think martinz and maseri both at 4.5 million should be on your watch list because between game weeks 2 and 13 they only have two red fixtures on the ticker one of's Liverpool at home one of's Aston Villa away and I think both look pretty nailed to start maybe masi if sure comes back but I think they they look good United looks strong if they sign ugat as well I think they've just got lot of lot of strength and depth and with the amount of players they've got substitutions and rotation could come in as well which obviously benefits Defenders and yeah they they limited Fulham who we thought might be quite good um this P so fulam only had the they had six shots in the box which is the third lowest of all teams didn't cre any big chances an XG of 0.4 so yeah for a team who probably quite fancy or we you and I definitely need them to start being good from an attacking point of view from now they were not good against United and last season I don't think we would have said that United gave up chances for fun so yeah yeah on them yeah interesting I I think people are maybe moving on them a bit prematurely possibly this Brighton game is not gonna be a clean sheet no I don't think so um and then I think after that who did you say it was they got Li what man unit got liver at home yeah so so that's not looking like one it's just yeah probably just a bit too soon in my opinion but after after that I think from Southampton at home there's a a good block of fixtures up until game week 13 though yeah I predicted masro would start and and he did and and got eight points like he looked like he was nailed on another bonus thing like he looked like he was nailed on for nine points and um yeah ended up getting taken away from him at the end and just end up on eight yeah yeah it look good um okay so do you want to keep going on on more stuff I don't really have too much else to say on United I think the only interesting factor I picked up on which wasn't worth speaking about in the other parts was the most shots in the Box this week it wasn't matom actually this was right it was such which was unbelievable really obviously played Aston Villa and all of his chances I think were headed chances which B well for CRA and Gabriel Aston Villa considered the second highest amount of headed chances this game week just gone so yeah I mean like I told told you earlier and I saw in the chat um I think it was davro said he's taking Conor out because of the price drop he's got got Lewis in I was quite happy to hold konzo because like I said at the start I feel like there's no if you got the cover there there's no real reason to to get rid of him like sometimes you can have a 4 million def o Defender is not starting but there's no reason no definite guarantee he's Dro you I've only got like one week but on the flip side I've got to work out who I'm going to play instead of him and who better than an Arsenal Defender I think the reason most people did it is because you know you've lost that 0.1 you can't get a 4.5 Defender now yeah you have to go down and when are you going to get that extra money from um the point Rises yeah it's probably gonna be a while so that's true might have to stick with him for a while now yeah but that's I think that's to be honest that's that's fine I thought that's a a small thing feel like not going to like win or lose on on pricing but not going to win anyway no I'm not going to do awful well um so yeah that was probably all I had on the the general notes really from this game week because there still quite a lot to yeah get out of there yeah I've got a few more honorable mentions um yeah bergal um a bit a bit of a strange one to bring up but 4.5 million for Tottenham um yeah I was super impressed by him when he came on I thought he played I think he played like sort of an attacking eish role um got 0.2 xgi 0.14 XA in 16 minutes which is pretty good um he'll come on it seems like pretty much most games he could start the next one because I think Puma is still uh suspended by by Spurs themselves and I think uh someone else someone got injured I can't remember um but yeah he he may end up starting next game so I think to be honest like if he's going to get most minutes and play attacking wise he's probably the best value 4.5 million M compared to other defensive ones that are going to get 90 minutes and and not many points um and he could come on get a couple assists or something like that so if you're looking for a 4.5 million mid um I think he's a good option um and then um yeah they just on the four million Defenders I suppose um a few of us have having troubles with them obviously Barco yeah yeah zero men's um I I heard he was supposedly rested but now we've got sort of information he's possibly on loan to Seva um which is um certainly not a deal I I started with him um I'm certainly worried about that but I'll probably just leave him Ro him on the bench for a while until he's possibly close to a drop and um may end up going for just Johnson who's the second guy um yeah he was benched but his replacement got hamstring injury so I think he should just be good to go from now on um Johnson I switch 4.0 and then obviously Greaves as we talked about earlier 4.0 it looks a decent threat from set pieces um fast or face however you say it at Leicester like they looked super suspect defensively so I'm not really Keen to go there but like he is going to play 90 minutes at least that's probably all you really need for um sort of 40 Defenders is just a backup in case you ever need them um yeah that Harwood Bellis guy at Southampton like again same as Lester like they didn't look good defensively they even conceded to 10 men obviously they didn't concede much XTC and stuff like that but they still conceded to 10 men and I don't think they're going to get many clean sheets at all um and then yeah moscara a wolves he's interesting I've just got hany down here like yeah CU he basically choked choked um hav on the floor and then he just you know got his finger up um someone else's bum as well wasn't it yeah so he's um yeah handsy as I say but four million um wolves I think from gamei was it nineish like their fix is like insane so um who knows if he's definitely nailed on but um I think he played 90 minutes didn't he but he looks like he's G to be sort of a bit of a worry for yellow cards possibly Reds um so I think um Johnson Greaves they look like the best two to be honest i' I'd agree like I think Johnson I'm still I liked him in preseason but the fact he didn't start makes you think he's not first choice in the difficult game so I would probably be boring and pick Greaves well I feel like now because like that his replacement got injured and he came on and did nothing wrong like why would he not like keep his place now yeah yeah okay all right I back but IPS witch are okay for fixtures now for quite a long time so up until gameweek basically after they don't play anyone or they play Fulham Brighton Southampton Villa West Ham Everton brenford Leicester have I said Leicester twice maybe basically they don't have any bad fixtures for between game weeks three and 10 and for 4.0 just someone to have on your bench he seems even beyond that far away if you had to in 11 is not that bad man united in at home 12 not that bad and then they got another four really good pictures but we'll be looking at probably like wild card around there anyway and but we'll probably be putting one of in so yeah yeah definitely like he's stands out as a Quanza replacement for when but that's obviously not take into account when Quanza gets back into the team this weekend and scores ah header should we look at a couple of questions quickly before yeah F so Alex K Kata said fod him for sun this week or roll um roll really okay I depends how much you like sun really cuz I thought he looked quite poor yeah he did but I think he was involved yeah yeah he was there was one clip I kept well I kept seeing where he like he got played into the box and he just had such a heavy touch maybe think he was he was off it don't know I don't to be honest I don't I don't mind it um City have got good fixtures foden's obviously likely going to start this weekend it's going to be a I wonder how his ownership's like it's probably pretty low I'm going to guess 20% just cuz Auto Select 70 so yeah he might some who's obviously came on last weekend don't see any reason why he wouldn't start this weekend so yeah I I think you probably picked Sun for the first two fixtures so in my opinion like it's early days just stick with you know stick to your guns and then roll that CH so like more information is better than points I think not points but yeah I don't know just just go with you got that I I don't think either option is bad and then yeah that Nadim IM said yeah triple Captain Harlem thoughts so we did mentioned this earlier but I would say um it's a decent shout I don't see why not like like you said the X points is uh really good u e switches defensive numbers are really bad but so yeah I think if you're gonna do it on a single game week this game week is the best one to do it and I would understand anyone doing it I'm just thinking that there's a if there's a chance for double game week with a top team in it I would probably take that option but you know like you said earlier as well which is a good point he's definitely going to start he's definitely going to there's no Champions League to worry about he's pretty likely going to play 90 minutes yep yeah I think it's good um Chris just said some kindal words said thought we'd we'd stop we actually came back last season we're only doing yeah we're just doing streams now now rather than recorded videos once a week and then Alex in the chat said grieve looks so threatening yeah so that's probably why I probably put him over Johnson but you know maybe's more chance of a headed headed goal than an open play one from it switch Yeah it probably is to be honest yeah all right let we talk about our our teams for this weekend yep I've got yours up first here okay so um yeah I think in the screenshot it's got Halls starting does but I think I will end up playing slever and benching Hall I think um the the sort of Ray card for sha and the defensive fraes I suppose Bournemouth for Newcastle prob probably GNA be highlighted I think a way to Bournemouth is not that good of a fixture for a defense that looked a bit shaky so um yeah I think I'll back the the better team in in Arsenal even though they've got a tougher fixture on paper um and then yeah parro is starting at the moment so it may may not end up mattering who I've benched first but I think parro is gonna be absolutely fine to be honest he was he was walking on it he didn't seem to have a boot at the end like he was just limping I think he was being being a bit dramatic um and then yeah so the same stuff bought Smith Row in um yeah because Hall is bench Smith Row in for the leester at home fixture hopefully he plays more than 60 odd minutes this week um that would be good but um yeah had a couple of chances where he's like sort of through and got sort of sliced down um so yeah hopefully he can just pick up a bit more um and then Salah captain at the moment Vice will probably end up on saaka I guess it's on it's on isak at the moment but um yeah Salah Captain seems like the stand out to me and my team nice I think looking at your your team a bit like mine as well Bruno and Smith row already I'm thinking could be um uh MoMA and and buo ahead of their good runs just trying to think think about what players can fill in some positions there I think that would be quite strong really yeah and even even jota like as far as um his fixtures go and how long he's nailed for let's let's see with him um and then yeah I need to possibly look at the Jefferson move out and try and get someone in I think yeah Bournemouth Striker that they' just brought in Evan nilson six million wasn't he yes six million I'm absolutely shocked by um because he was so good for Porto like so good um obviously it's a bit of a step up in terms of league but like he was really good in the Champions League as well he was scoring goals for fun for Porto so um yeah I'm quite high on him is that the same guy we had in UCL last year must have been should be yeah there was that galeno but then there was also that Evan neelson and he was the starting Striker and he just was scoring goals all the time so um yeah so shame for him to have to go to Bournemouth and play with who he's playing with but um you know I shocked they even got him because he seemed like he could be going to a much bigger team than bouth so and they got him done quickly as well really much F so he's probably gonna screw over my um Jefferson anyway so I'm probably gonna need to move move that guy out so yeah seeno obviously the pretty good at Bourn of to so their fixtures look a bit mixed yeah they are a bit mixed but um yeah six million can't really go too wrong I tell you what was a good question I watch the FPL Y show which I like that one um and they asked a good question when they were talking about their teams at the end they said if you could have two changes now in hindsight to your gameweek one team not do yeah I like those guys um I don't know I probably wouldn't have had Hall I think I would have gone for the um a bit more like rotation better like someone like Robinson just because he's got a better fixture this week and I would have been not a problem to just play him um yeah and then probably just not done the 352 I think I would have got a forward like a Pedro or something but then I probably would have had to get rid of s that point but no I think I'm I was fairly happy apart from maybe Hall yeah that's fair that's fair no I think the team looks good for this week um right let's have a look here um see I'm fairly similar again really the only thing I obviously don't have like I mentioned quite a few times is any Liverpool cover harand AR makes sense I'm going to slanky Vice Captain but I don't think there's any chance he doesn't play probably put Quanza first bench over cona don't know for porro maybe that'll maybe I'll change that as it gets down to it just because the games last season were close obviously Henderson goal like you porro Robinson Cela Fernandez I'm looking forward to e against West Ham I think he was unlucky and West Ham were a bit mixed as well Smith row he's already a bit like uh I hope it I haven't been wrong about him so he's got a couple games now already got some good fixtures so let let's see yeah I think team how' you feel about Henderson now that Anderson's gone to not so good really it's like stuck up for Robinson but stuck down for Henderson yeah I thought it would probably happen because it they obviously came out before the deadline that they were talking to him definitely surely surely they're not going to sell gay now can't imagine it there was there was another it might have been onstein again today that said that they'd already made contact with a Defender from Wolf ber or something who glasner had worked with before okay so that kind of seemed like they obviously had a replacement lined up so you know we'll see I don't think their defense is like Elite anyway I think they're quite open I think Henderson's more a pick for the fixtures and the the potential save points so it was obviously disappointing when he played fleen who was like the other one I thought about all preseason and even after one game fen's come out with like a ton of saves so yeah we'll see brenford didn't clean sheet did they no no it was remember it was the own goal Moos that it of course yeah so yeah we'll see I'm already a bit like like I was on the Harland draft pretty much all preseason and I think it's only just because Salah scored I'm a bit like oh look what you could have had kind of thing but the only player I'm missing is I I think at the moment is Trent because like I said I think Salah can cover so you know with a little bit of jiggery pokery Fernandez could be a matoma or I don't know 7 million or less and and porro could easily be Trent cuz yeah so there's there's things I could could do there um just have to see really yeah yeah we'll see how we are next week I hadn't planned to make a transfer until the start of game week four anyway so not making a transfer until late September bit boring is it yeah we we've two next week I'll be looking at um how many minutes J gets um I'll be yeah Josh and Bruno are the ones I'll be sort of looking at um for possibly moving on yeah cool all right well should we wrap it up there yeah yeah cool q& TV says he's on 83 points very nice good week very nice week right thanks everyone for joining us we'll be back next Wednesday evening same time um to to see how we get on again week to let's get the sofas ready for Salah and Harland I'm yeah I'm worried phone notifications off yes all right thanks,10461
1,TheArmbandFPL,RtkI_Txs8zk,GW1 TEAM REVEALS | SALAH ONLY? HAALAND ONLY! | FPL ARMBAND,2024-08-16T05:41:11Z,"[Music] [Music] he [Music] [Music] [Music] hello everyone and welcome to the FPL armband I'm Chris Kieran is here too how are you today Eve of the new season excited um apprehensive but yeah looking forward to it yeah same I feel like it seems like a long preseason probably because of the amount of like drafts I've been doing I know I've been doing it feels like a way longer time than you have but yeah now we're finally getting down to it it's just like final few positions trying to decide on which is not usually the case for you I think you're usually like a few drafts and I know I know I've been really like I don't know going back and forth on a lot of like e or ORS started this season so yeah know look I'm really looking forward to it I think um can't wait for it to get started tomorrow night and it's one of those one of those feelings as well like I want players in like all like a lot of the games this weekend as well so like I feel like that's impacted on my pick because I'm even might be like best for my team it just might be quite exciting so yeah right let's get on to it um we're going to start off by talking about uh Chelsea and um uh Man City the probably the biggest game of the weekend I I suppose um two top teams or supposedly top teams clashing and also there's quite a lot of like ownership dilemmas there and then we we're obviously going to talk with some of the other top teams and then yeah do a bit of our our team reveal so man city Chelsea they've only just recently played each other preseason we all know that was very open game think trying to forget about that one yeah I know har got his hattick I mean you've gone straight away off this week at least you're on no Harland how how's that come about and how I don't know fearful are you going to be every weekend do you think um I'm not going to sugarcoat it like I just feel like um he's probably not worth the 15 million just just feels like too expensive um he goes like missing in so many games um he get he can easily be manm marked in a game it seems like um like we saw in the community shield and we've seen it plenty of times during the Premier League so I'm just I just you know we've not seen a 15 million asset before I've just come around to the thinking of just like I prefer the spread of just other good assets yeah than just having Harland um and that's just I've been yeah constantly tinkering with Harland and saladas or just Harland and other ones and I've just never really been happy and and until I F I actually finally looked at no harand and and I just started to look at the draw I was just like yeah I prefer this much more you're right I mean what this takes us back to as soon as the game launched like I think immediately I was like no harand seems like the way to go because you're right because the spread of of fun seem so much more possible like we never had a player this expensive we could get a really good like deep Squad of of top Heavy Hitters from last season quite easily and I think when the game launched his ownership was just like let's say in the first day it was 30% it's crept up to nearly 50 now I expect that to be probably slightly Higher by by this time tomorrow but yeah I totally get your points to be honest like it's you know it's a big investment in one player and if that one player isn't delivering and let's say the cheaper players to support that um then yeah I think you you're going to you're going to feel that and that's why yeah the pricing has been done well I feel like he has got some good fixtures at least to start this season against teams who you know potentially not going to be very good defensively so we've seen Chelsea in preseason been absolutely shocking we've talked about that before in the last few weeks I expect he he's probably going to score this weekend they've got IP switch at home which is a bit of an unknown because you know that they looked fairly solid in preseason they had the um the best pre uh best defensive record in the Champion League as far as I know um and they've only strengthened there I think so I I don't think if is gonna be a complete routing as far as I know yeah I don't I don't think so either and then it's it's West Ham away I mean they they're good fixtures on paper obviously most pictures for City are good so it will be decisive this first weekend I think to see how Sal and hen Salah Salah and harand do well I was like combining them there uh yeah just to to see how that leads into our teams for game week two where we're going to like rip up our our best L plans after one game week or going to stick firm by it yeah admittedly like the fixtures that start are not the best to go without him I get that but I also think like brenford in four is is aough game like brenford have been pretty good against them recently um and I just hope that that Chelsea can possibly keep it lowish I think that's a possibility I think it's a 44 I can't see anything like that happening so um like obviously last season um so yeah I'm just just hoping for the best and I just you know gotta not be so scared of the the one person I guess yeah I was a bit gutted about um Oscar Bob and it seems I don't think they've officially announced that yet but the the strong rumors is that he's like fractured his his leg so he's going to be out for a long time but he was looking so hot in this preseason and he could have been like a cheeky pick at five million Midfield even if only for the opening game weeks do you think they're going to there been obviously talk of e a little bit which is interesting because he's got high ownership at the start of the season do you think they're probably going to buy a player to fit in the Gap if they've lost they've lost Alvarez now as well as Bob in like the last week and half I think most of um fbl or in just football X or whatever Twitter seem to think he will I think Janos probably think that they will because there has been you supposedly they've been starting to talk to e about the the 60 million release course I think it is so um yeah I think it would make sense with seeing they've lost two attacking players um in depth and not bought anyone in that it to me that makes sense that they would um you know s svino Savio yeah he's obviously new like are they really going to want to Chuck him in straight away probably not so and greish I think is still got a bit of an injury so um foden I guess not really played any preseason minutes so there's you know the depth has definitely took a hit and kdb is obviously getting older as well and so so yeah I I feel like they probably will but maybe get in there before this um sort of trial thing happens towards Christmas time I think it isn't it so yeah yeah and the thing about harand and city as well which you know probably factors in to his expected minutes this season because they haven't got any backup striker in the league how much he's going to get you know preserved let's say to because they're going to be on you know three competitions Champions League starts I think it's around game week four so there's going to be I would expect rotation to make sure harand stays fit I mean he had an injury last season pep took him off in preseason so I think there is a a bit of a background like injury management like risks which will perhaps impact his X minutes but I suppose for me I'm just hoping that in the games he does play he's he's big yeah a backup Striker makes sense more than E I would I would guess um yeah obviously Bob is not Striker um but obviously Alvarez I guess probably is around that sort of false nine Striker teny sort of player so I think yeah a backup Striker would make more sense to me um so I I think e owner's maybe not so shouldn't be that scared until anything actually conr happen that's true maybe his head is turn who knows it'll probably about like don't know 6:30 tomorrow or like late the onstein tweets that yeah's on six books um let's just quickly talk about Chelsea do you have in cuckoo and cuckoo on your team I don't anymore um probably for the reasons you're about to say yeah well I think it's interesting that he's so highly own so he's up at 177% last time I checked he's just not been anywhere near uh let's have a look what he's on now he's not just not been anywhere near any of my dra he's still 17 my drafts like I get that Chelsea have got good fixtures I kind of think he's been a bit hyped by this preseason so he's got three goals one assist two of the goals were were penalties obviously neto's come in it looks like Felix or J Felix might come in as well before the close of the transfer window and oh you'll know how to pronounce aan like so that's like three players have come in in again in the last well potentially let's say three players are going to come in now between now and the end of the window that are going to be in the attacking area and they're not signing I doubt at least two of those to be backup so you know maybe he'll play number 10 maybe he'll be play left wing I just don't get I don't know I just don't get his appeal I get that he's a good player but Chelsea seem unsettled and their lineup seems unsettled I just don't get why he's such a a pick do you get do you get it he's not on set pieces I think he's much better than Felix in my opinion um so I think he would start ahead of him personally um but doesn't mean yeah he he might go to the left cuz the left is the spot that's probably a little bit open yeah um with Sterling and Madrick and um so there's there's no stand out there really um but do you think that makes him like any better a pick than someone like garnacho like garnacho 65 he plays on the wing he's like he had a decent season last season well he's he's probably twice the player G natur as I would say do you think okay yeah I think so um yeah I think he's still a good option I I think I think he should play most the minutes but like that's just guessing I guess um and and someone like you know people are looking at jot and I I obiously don't have unu at the moment he might he might be the perfect player to go down to when the fixtures get really good from two three onwards and and we see that he's playing so I like him um for the future perhaps not game one against City the we talked about that fix blocker is good wolves Palace Bournemouth West Ham Brighton and Forest in between two and seven it'll be a real test of like I kind of feel in my mind moresa is getting sacked before that game against forest in October just I just think it all just looks a shambles at the moment but uh we'll see we'll see right should we talk about another another fixture sure yeah um okay so Arsenal versus V obviously the um other probably um main Contender for the league I suppose in Arsenal um yeah their preseason form's been obviously really good they've had 10 goals scored four conceded um three wins one draw one loss and yeah the head-to-head history in the Premier League against wolves uh so the last six they've Arsenal won all of them in a row and a agregat score of 14-2 so that's um been some beating they've been putting on wolves um yeah so Arsenal first team pretty much in the last preseason games have been very convincing to me anyway from the highlights I've watched and they looked great against Leverkusen won 41 there um I think the the one goal was sort of a late constellation um and then yeah against Leon two-nil win looked completely dominant the defense looked solid as hell as ever um so yeah I'm I'm in the sort of Camp of being like I know I wasn't last episode but you sort of sway me towards this of just being like Arsenal I think um are just going to go strength to strength again they're just going to get better again I think the defense is going to even be even more solid nothing's changed there as it so they got apart from better backup again so um yeah I i' looking at a Defender um whether it's CRA or Gabrielle I think Gabrielle should still be nailed I I mean I think um we can't really know that suppose are you gonna go with Gabrielle over CA or you hav either yeah I think it's really difficult um I do have one of them in my team I have SL at the moment um but it could easily be Gabrielle um Gabrielle like um if I go down to him him as a pick he's 12% compared to cba's 39% ownership at the moment so that's a big difference um Gabrielle got three goals one assist verus CBA two goals one assist so that's not much in that but um yeah 4.48 XG for Gabrielle across the season um which was top of all Defenders like three times basically X the XG of selas which is 1.7 so 4.4 to 1.7 so you can clearly see that the the goal threat is in Gabriel's favor by a long way so I mean you had 25 head CH headed chances uh last season which is second of all Defenders and there seven big chances for himself second of all Defenders so randomly enough um the the ones that are Bea him beating him on those headed chances and big Chances Are A Romero at Spurs and nobody's really talking about him so um interesting he clearly has go thrat from you know those set pieces so um yeah Gabriel SL slav obviously nailed on people are talking about Timber possibly being like a bit of a backup to to like to CBA so there could be rotation there CU s played like every single minute of pretty much every game for Arsenal didn't he the important ones anyway um and then calor is like a a left back backup slash backup to Gabrielle um so who's more more likely to be rotate um yeah I don't know I don't think he will rotate either of them to be honest so I guess yeah I think cba's minutes the last two seasons of well maybe it wasn't the season before last last season he basically didn't miss a minute 3,4 20 he he was just reliable and I kind of think based on how good he was for France in the Euros as well he is just like a top tier Defender so 100% yeah I feel like he's definitely more nailed than Gabrielle is but at the same time I just having a look at last season's like numbers across the season so you're right Gabrielle's XG across the season was 4.48 and Cel was 1.7 so huge disparity there but you know it's not easy to score ahead of chance which probably why he's only got like one more attack in return I I feel like I've I got burnt at the start of last season when I missed both did yeah so that's probably my main reason for picking Cel but even though Gabrielle I agree has got the bigger goal threat does that mean it'll happen again possibly not I don't know I just feel like with more comp you're right I feel like more competition now Timber's back and calfor is there he's already shown that he would drop Gabrielle and not CBA will he do it again so yeah it just feels like yeah maybe cra is just safer yeah yeah I'm probably taking enough risks as it is so s is probably a decent decent Choice um so yeah uh what El so wolves preseason form there had two losses two wins seven goals scored five conceded um they've just sold arguably their best player to Chelsea as well in the Netto um yeah they finished their last WM up game with a loss um and not didn't score in it either so that's not great form um and then just on Arsenal as well the totally football show podcast I I listen to three of the four journalists predicted Arsenal to win the league so that's interesting as well ahead of city um so yeah um Arsenal looking good um but yeah sacka you know he played 45 minutes I think and then some minutes in another one of the preseason games so I think he's good to go um 16 goals 12 assists last year um played through sort of like a constant injury so hopefully he's okay now seems to be at least um played pretty much all the minutes in for England didn't he as well so um fixtures obviously certainly aren't the best but I think from attacking wise I don't see any issues in picking sacket to be honest I think their attack is going to be good um probably you know the lowest ownership percent he's gonna you'll find most basically all season I would guess like 29 under 30% that's pretty good um I think like he's possibly captain of all in this fixture well so yeah um and then just rice obviously in the last um he's had obviously a huge bump I think it's a million 5.5 Million last year possibly um yeah 6.5 million now 6% and the two goals in the last preseason game were from his Corners straight to the heads of CRA and Gabriel so um yeah it's almost certainly too expensive to pick him as a 6.5 million sort of CM yeah or possibly eight I guess um but you know he provided a lot of points last season so maybe he can do it again um yeah and then I was this guy was in my draft for time as well I was I was really pumped on I think hav is going to have a great season 8 million 14% own at the moment um would have been the third highest scoring forward if classified as a as a forward last season which is interesting as well um ahead of zanki and isak who both had great Seasons so um yeah in my opinion he's fully nailed on um started striker in the final warm up game as well um with Jesus being benched and then Jesus came on again um but he wasn't hooked for Jesus he kept he stayed on and then he did eventually go off just for obviously rest but he's not being hooked for Jesus he's staying on the pitch which is obviously very important um yeah 13 goals 10 assist last year I think clearly just needed to be in a consistent team starting week in week out and and he's he's showing his worth um yeah and then just finally from the woles side I don't think there's anyone really worth picking at the moment the fixtures are pretty bad um yeah but there's 5.5 million Ricardo Gomez has looked um bright in preseason and I think he's going to be the one that sort of replaces Netto um and then um but game week nine onwards I think we're all going to start to look at them they've got Brighton Crystal Palace Southampton Fulham Bournemouth Everton West Ham Leicester in a row so that's um that's amazing run from then which um yeah we'll start to look at territory yeah Kya I don't think he's fully fit at the moment which is I'm a shame but um yeah ik Nori at 4.5 again is is gonna be good value um and then yeah any of there forwards um that's strand Lon I think he's come from he's going to be there number nine because I think K is supposed to be playing the 10 this year uh so strand Lon has come from the leager I think he had something like 15 goals something like that so yeah he's only 5.5 million and he looks to be the starter for starting Striker for woles so that's going to be value as well yeah nice what I will say on Arsenal just actually before we we move on it is I think there's like a valid strategy if you're thinking about playing the early wild card to not have Arsenal players until game week six sure because they got as Aston Villa City and Spurs away in the first five game weeks are all difficult games are they going to get enough halls in wolves and Brighton for the Defenders and attackers to justify that over five games and not sure I I don't think V Viller is a thing you should worry about and I don't think Spurs way is a thing to worry about for attack yeah I don't think it's anything to worry about for a defense either like I could see them going to Villa away and keeping I just think Villa are not gonna be as good this year so yeah so unfortunately yeah maybe true and last year at the end of last season Arsenal did go to Spurs and play really well sacka and have sort of returned from a big score so yeah that could feasibly happen again I just think with City clearly losing some good players I just think they're probably the best team in the league and just yeah they they are the hard fixture that they should be fixture proof to me I think that if it was the only reason I still like think City stronger I just feel like that Martin Le SL trar position needs to be like slightly slightly stronger I feel like H's found that like a it's like he and sacka probably like the main go threats TR hard chip in with a few I don't know I just feels like they're one quality like forward away from dominating games I think one of the stats I read earlier was they didn't score in like five League games last season which you know for a team that finished second last season that's quite a lot really so but no I hav Saka and the others can chip in I don't know I still can't see p City but let's hope they can because it'll make it interesting yeah I would love to see City not in the league and and Arsenal seemed to be the next cles so fair enough yeah um right let's kick off well turn to the game that kicks off actually the season M United against Fulham um both managers the same Fulham won this fixer last season 2-1 um I do think it's an interesting start to the season there's like a lot of positivity about around United I think probably the new owners have have helped instill that and I just I'm not I'm not sure I feel like I've so I've been turned on Bruno Fernandez because I wanted to get like you knowed United have got some good fixtures to start the season Fulham Brighton Liverpool at home was a a good game last season he did well in Southampton away Palace away that that's not like a bad front five for for them and and Fernandez at the same price he was last season is is okay as well I just I'm just not sure about like what's changed from them being overrunning Midfield last year to make this quite an open open game still like they haven't signed defensive midfielder they're still going to have casemiro Mount or manu and Fernandez to pick from if if although Fernandez might play that false nine role with holand d which you know makes him an even a slightly more interesting pick as well I just feel like Fulham are going to go their opening night of the Premier League they've got nothing to lose I can just I just see an open open game tomorrow good chance for fulham's attackers who have got great fixtures after this as well as well how how do you see the the game going um yeah really hard to call I think um yeah FM should be confident you know they just signed in EML Smith row and he scored two of the preseason already and I've currently got in my team I've got Ms Smith R bench because i' you know I've got good other fixtures like sort of make sense but but at the same time I think United's defense has has definitely had an upgrade with d and and mazra so I think they'll they should probably both come in might be a bit harsh for Maguire to be benched for deit but um I can see Del deit martinz and mazra is are starting back for um so and and that on paper is is really good um Can Fulham go there and score against United at home in the first game of the season it's tough I think that'll be yeah just prob probably just an open game got probably like one goal each maybe like a one1 I could see something yeah yeah it's defin I just wanted to mention it tonight because I think you know Bruno seems it's funny I thought he would seem more template than he is he's only 177% ownership garnacho is 16% don't know I just feel that there's quite a lot of decisions will well quite a lot of moves that will come off the back of this because of fulham's good run after this and because it's going to be a new look United from a defensive point of view we think and what like investment we could we can have there did the L come in at five five yeah Ma 4.5 so I think ma Masari should come in straight away because Shaw is injured and and both of them have good preseason minutes for Bayern so um I I don't see any reason why he won't start along on the left back or or Delo possibly playing left back and him playing right back because he is he is a right back yeah okay I think it's going to be a really good first game to kick us off and I'm like you I'm like on looking at my team just slightly I'm going to have Smith as well and I'm happy to think I'm happy to play him tomorrow even though the fixture looks bad on the ticker you want to have like a good home fctory in the first game week I think it's going to be an open game and the fact that Fulham were confident enough to go there last season and win and United's Midfield has been open let's say end of last season nothing too much has changed there I feel like he might have a little bit of space to do something yeah I have the option to play him so so yeah I may end up doing that yeah all right should we talk about another another couple fixtures before sharing where we are yeah okay so um if Liverpool um yeah Liverpool obviously probably expecting to be the third team um to to chase for the title um yeah good preseason form again four wins one draw one draw uh 10 goals scored two conceded um defensive form looks like he been pretty good um you know as well as Trent coming back van djk coming back and all getting good solid minutes in the preseason so um but then yeah coner 4.5 million um he started to pick up some ownership he's he's 1.9% made the notes I'm sure that's probably gone up quite a bit okay so yeah um all aboard the sort of concer train I guess like um yeah he started four of the last preseason minutes he started in the one where it looked like it was all the four first choices the one was with Salah and Trent all that stuff um so yeah he looks like he's the first choice to me alongside van djk um you know sort of ended the season playing all the games as well didn't he say um two go scored last season from 13 starts that's not too bad um van Dy um CBA managed the same in 36 to 38 starts last season so yeah he's pretty much halfed it there which is great um the problem is I think with him he's he's possibly he's good as a sort of cover of the defense for Trent but he's not obviously he's going to cover the clean sheets but he's not going to cover any really much attacking returns you'd imagine um but at the same time he takes up a third Li spot too um and obviously that run of fixtures is is really damn good at the the season so obviously if Swit brenford United I don't think United away is is anything you can worry about for the attack anyway um Forest Bournemouth wolves Crystal Palace all at the start of the season so yeah those are all great fixtures so um yeah if you're looking towards a trip up if they start to look really really good um yeah K Quanza could be an issue but you know maybe not a definite issue but um yeah he's he's certainly not fully nailed on from from rotation like canate is still there like breathing down his neck um but at the moment he looks like he's suiting like slot system of wanting to pass out the back and and Konza seems better at that than than canate so yeah I think it's interesting that he um I don't know I feel like it's interesting he's picked up a lot of momentum when Liverpool a bit like man united haven't like strengthened their defense well haven't signed anyone this summer Liverpool only kept nine clean sheets last season that was the same amount as man united but like he seemed like super sexy for some reason but like there's like let's say Martinez at United is pretty much nailed on Center back and he's also 4 five and United's fixtures are probably not quite as good but like he's more nailed and in a team that did as well defensively do you know what I mean I just think it's it's fun I want him as well but maybe I'm a bit swept up in it I think a lot of people are thinking slot's goingon to be better defensively um and then yeah just a 4.5 million cover in that Lial defense with where everyone where other people are looking at Trent it's just people are trying to you know people aren't looking at United because nobody's really going there so like people are trying to cover it for cheap yeah I think so no I agree with you um okay so Trent um 7 million this year obviously got a big um price drop 24% he's obviously fit now had played pretty much a full game um in the last preseason so he's got minutes um and then provided a great assist um for Joss's goal um looks like he's going to be in that sort of wide Central Area on that right and and he's going to be providing quite a lot this season so um yeah for me looked sharp he was getting forward um and it's pretty hard to ignore him at 7even million I think a few years ago when he was around seven he was pretty much Essential so um yeah for me I've I've wanted him in my team some of the drafts have just been impossible with owning like Salah and and harand and stuff like that and but yeah having got rid of harand um he's he's in for me um yeah the fixtures look so good so I'm I'm just there for you know the Trent train and hoping he hoping he does well and he's obviously a cash he's obviously a cash cow for basically any Defender so yeah um happy to move off him if he's if he's not looking good um and then I guess I don't know if he's in your team um probably not because I think you're a bit of bit scared of his irritation but J yeah 7.5 million 6.2% when I I did this but it's probably G way he 12 now he's like doubled his own okay yeah so I've got is he a trap here I I mean yes probably but he's he's a good trap we think um yeah he's obviously fit in preseason goal and assist in the last matchup um versus a good severe side um yeah good holdup play um he only had one shot in that game which is a bit concerning but and it was nice screamer as well of course yes yeah a great go um but yeah he seems to like sort of he's played more minutes under slot in preseason and he seems to have sort of looks like he's going to be the starter towards the start of the Season ahead of Nunes um just because he's played more fit um and he's just been seen more I guess and and whenever he seems to play he he gets points like um yeah always provides value when he said he's got 10 goals seven assists in just 1,141 minutes last year which is like under half the minutes of the whole season so an average return of 67 minutes or a return every 67 minutes which is really good as well so um competition from Nunes obviously um maybe gapco but I think gapco is more of a competition for Diaz on the right so or the left sorry um so yeah I've just got down here jotter versus Salah stats per start so um this is just to show that Salah jotter provides good value when he starts right so points um 6.2 versus 7even so salad just shading but not by much um goals 0.57 versus 0.6 first start um yeah not much in that either XG of .7 for J versus 0.2 oh actually I think that was the other way around .2 for jot 0.7 for sah um I think that's probably do with penalties as well um XA of 0.07 versus 0.26 so a little bit in Sal's favor but then expected points 3.9 versus seven which is bigly in J big in Sal but um yeah points wise yeah the actual points scored of 6.2 versus seven um you know there's B not much in it and it's like how much is it like 4ish million um maybe more than that um between them so yeah must be five million is it okay five million um yeah so he seems like he's gonna start at least the first few um he's a good price point that you can sort of just move down to whoever's doing well yeah um so I think he's he's worth picking at the start of the season for me anyway um do you want to mention what you think about him yeah um I like I like y don't don't get me wrong like he's done well for me before and he's definitely someone if if we have anything tomorrow about e which I think might be unlikely but if we do anything about e I'm probably going to find .5 million to do e to to yot I've also thought about maybe Bruno down to Y I think I don't know it seems like a I've tried to pick players that potentially aren't unknowns and because as a new manager there is a little bit of an unknown but from what we've seen in he just in two preseason games essentially it looks like he's going to be the first choice number nine but all it took was like Liverpool account earlier to post a picture of Nunes with a little heart and I was just like oh see he's he's just got competition there and maybe he will start and a bit like Konza be template or be be First Choice in that team so yeah it's hard to we've got some exciting options in salanki and yot perhaps not as exciting for salanki because he's a Striker but cheap players who look like they're gonna be playing Center forwards in good sides I think he's just um we we're yeah I think if he plays well he should start the last the first few um but he's obviously going to come off around 60 70 minutes um but we just got to hope he's hauling in that time and I think he obviously does have that ceiling of like you know he can get 12 a couple goals or a goal and assist like he did in that last game against sea in the preseason so um yeah for 7.5 million that seems like good value um and I think he's yeah like I said he's easy to jump off of yeah chelse and Liverpool have got such good fixtures for the first eight that's the biggest like concern I think with my team like I don't think with harand I don't think I can have silon I just not sure he's going to justify that but when you look at that pretty much that opening eight fixtures if it goes well against dip switch in the the first game and even brenford in the second game I feel like there's going to be such a a shift because it's going to turn into a bit of a known quantity really yeah from what I saw in Salah in the last one it just didn't like kind of fall for him in front of goal he nearly had a couple goals nearly had a couple assists like another day he's he's hauling versus that severe in that severe game so um I think just yeah like with Harland in his debut season in the community Shield we we saw him and then he he had the chances yeah he did miss them but you know that that he's looking sharp and he's getting the chances and he's going to start putting them in so yeah I think that was where Salah was looking so yeah abely should we go on to talk about our teams and then yes we should because I think talk about leester Spurs a little bit while um I talk or talk about our our teams right let's put yours up first considering we've just been talking on the back of that and you are very heavy on all the Liverpool big boys aren't you yeah so so my har andless draft um yeah so the goalkeepers I I think I'll probably end up with this Flack and and brenford combo um I quite like the West ones as well like just because I think they're going to get a ton of save points um so there's that but not really probably not many clean sheets but um yeah I like the look of Henderson obviously but I don't like that there's not really a four zero to go with him um so I've got Muno um instead and I think he's going to be a great pick um yeah so triple Liverpool with Trent jot and S at the moment um i' got sver and sacker in there and then I've got B at the moment there's noise of him you know possibly not being um sort of nailed on for the first five or six he's possibly going to play the first couple so I think he may be removed um H I'm looking at as someone who basically should be nailed on yeah I like him as a lot as well like all the Newcastle fans and all just saying that he is his shirt to lose in that left back role um and yeah he's looking like he should be picked for England pretty soon as as a sh replacement as well like the yeah the sky is sort of the limit for him he's had a goal goal and assist in preseason um yeah the fixtures to start with look good this this first fixture looks amazing for him um yeah Bourn of way after that like Spurs at home don't think too bad wolves after that Fulham after that like they're great um yeah then I've got Gordon there Gordon I'm a little bit worried about for minutes but I think he absolutely should start start yeah yeah so um and he you know he scored in his preseason game in his in his limited minutes and I think he's gonna probably have a really good season again to be honest did you even own him last season I didn't no I didn't own him even once yeah um so yeah getting on that early this season I guess um then the yeah the front tier slank and isak isak um yeah nailed on in all my drafts in most people's drafts I don't think he's going anywhere um salanki I I just wanted to have something in that Monday night game I think he should be good to go to start um he's got a better penalty record than sun I don't know if he's gonna take them of them but there's that um and I think he's just going to get way more chances in this team um and he scored 19 goals for Bournemouth so why would that not go up um yeah then first bench is Smith row I may end up just doing Smith Row in um bench Barco probably take Barco out for Johnson at ipswitch yeah attacking attacking right back is it or left back right back I think yeah and so maybe play Smith row or play Munos um and then yeah the last one on the bench is just the fodder um which yeah I've got 1.5 in the bank as well really from this I do yes okay which is um for sank to Watkins in game three which I think most people if they're not selling Harland won't be able to get to so I think that is and that's exactly when Spurs fixtures get a bit crappy for the next two as well so they got Newcastle away and Arsenal at home which I don't love for them so um I'll be looking at um Watkins for that really good run for for Villa nice yeah I think it looks good how how confident are you with like 24 hours to go that you're not going to panic and get Harlem back in or do you think you're pretty set on this now because you I feel like you've been on this idea for honestly day or I think I am quite set um it's just whether I um don't go with j and go for someone like an e um and and if I go for Gabrielle instead of CBA um and then that's that's honestly pretty much it um I like Smith especially for his fixtures um in two and three and four yeah which is Leicester ipswitch West Ham so two promoted teams in a row that seems great um so yeah Gordon I'm a bit worried about but like at the same time I think he absolutely should play um and it'll be good to go for game week two at least as well so yeah I'm pretty happy honestly yeah I think it looks I think it looks good to be honest I didn't even looking at it I thought you would have maxed out said hey you got 1.5 in the bank I was surprised too that I could basically the people who are doing this are bu are getting um gardio instead of like M that's what that they're spending their money um and I just kept that in the bank just so I don't need I don't need to do those transfers yeah mun I think is a great option so he looks so good I watched the the highlights of that game to see how e was playing to be fair e had loads of chances in that last preseason game um but Munos just like closing down the keeper in the box and just hanging out in the edge of the Box all the time I would love to play him as well but yeah it's tough I don't know i' probably play him over Barco to be honest well exactly but I'm saying I might play Smith row instead so yeah no I think it looks good you love a fall 42 as well I feel like to start the season that's that's only happened due to benching through like I would usually play the fre five2 that looks good looks good mine's mine we got any more to add on on that before no move on to yours yeah go so I think we're you know we're vaguely similar apart from the big Harland difference so flecken the same I just don't think there's a my second choice would be Henderson like I said to you earlier I feel like if Henderson and Matthews that kind of rules me out getting Munos cuz I'm already at three players and I like to have the backup as well yeah I did think about that yeah so then in defense celba even though Arsenal's fixures aren't great I just feel like there's like a hopefully Banker clean sheets and one and three porro who you haven't got I to think it seems like a steel like at this season 5.5 million you compare him to some of the like wishy-washy 5.5 million mids he's done well in preseason Spurs aren't great defensively but they weren't last last season and he still did really well I feel like he's don't know I feel like he's a bit underpriced at 5'5 so yeah I'll have him at least for these first two game weeks and actually like that Leicester Leicester game Leicester haven't scored in their last three preseason games and then they've got Everton at home in gameweek two so it's going to give me a good read to see how good they are yep I mean I I could get him I've got that money to do it but yeah and for the longest time as you know I had the reverse Midfield so I had sun and someone like J Pedro 5.5 million but I've recently sort of flipped to Fernandez and salanki which I think Pedro's first couple of fixtures aren't aren't great and I'd say Lester away and Everton home for slanky look good and we've already talked about Bruno I think he got quite good fixtures obviously Harland isack up front I'm playing Smith row I've got e away at brenford which I quite like and the bench is probably like a little stronger than I would usually have so I've got no money in the bank I've got Quanza first bench to come in and I got Robinson as well who I I quite like for so my defensive rotations look good I don't have any money to to get to Watkins in gameing through or any like forward plans at the moment like that but I think I'm quite happy to see how this lot do for the first two game weeks and then obviously can pivot after that the ones I'm not 100% convinced on is probably Bruno Just because of last season being a bit of a burn at the start but I think he's at a good price point where there's a lot of money in him rather than spreading so I think it's you know there's options from from there so just uh you know getting kungu oh God I'm surprised like I hadn't seen yours um and there's I I wasn't expecting Hall in there I was not expecting Bruno and yeah I wasn't expecting quanzo even though we've talked about him and you're you're benching him which is interesting as well so yeah not sure if i' yeah it's difficult I'm back in Hall celra obviously home games I think P's defensive output's better and I just I'd rather play Smith Rover than a Defender because it's fun that makes sense um but yeah that you know obviously he'll come in and play I think he's going to play like the first three of the next five games if he stays in the team so no I think it it's probably got a decent balance to it I've tried to pick penalty takers um I suppose you wouldn't want Gordon instead of Bruno because you don't like double ups and stuff to you not the not at the start immediately especially now G's a bit more expensive but no I've changed it quite a lot and even last night I was telling you wasn't I that oh expect to see this draft on the show and I have Munos in it and got since then but yeah I feel pretty settled on this now yeah so yeah jotter like Bruno instead of jotter maybe yeah I could do something like that that's interesting yeah we'll see how see how it um I see how I feel about tomorrow night but it look in yeah I would also be a bit annoyed if um yeah everyone just like there's so many people not bothering with Sal and just having J and I'd be really annoyed if I missed out on yeah that because even I had him for a while um I'd be pissed if I've gone for the more expensive guy and he's he's blanked while jot has you gone away with you know 12 points or something really annoying I think that is the the main yeah the main worry with with having two of the attackers because you don't want to have like the cheaper one outperform the the better one but I think the fixtures are the good enough for Liverpool that's like I said earlier I think that's the main like pain Point potentially from here is that Liverpool have a really good start of the Season Yas good but I think I've tried to pick players who look like they're going to play a lot of minutes to start the season that only maybe is Quanza no I think he's fine so I think it looks yeah I think it's okay yeah I think I only really need to look at that J pick really jotter for Bruno maybe makes sense because I do have seller and Trent can you get oh you got the money haven't you yeah I do have that money so yeah it might make sense to tie money up in the players cuz n if they obviously go up in value that's what I'm kind of hoping by having rather than leaving that5 like I had planned to do if Quanza goes up in in price after a good first game week even if I'm not playing him then I'm already thinking that you know after that Robinson's got some good potential so thinking more about the squad value and we can think about that this season because we' got more money to spend by not having two big hitters I suppose are you worried by um Bruno and Smith Rose starting in that first game of the season on the Friday night you're just if you got two blanks and you're two players behind everyone else that that would suck that would suck but you know I it was an open game last season yeah and two there was goals scored in there so let's see and to be honest you know players blank all the time har could blank that would suck that would that would be the one that sucked oh we haven't talked about Captain I was gonna say yeah I'm I'm tempted by Salah obviously um I I mean I like isak as Captain um but like should I just Captain S I don't know maybe I think the the the obvious one is is eak and I yeah Saka is worth a punt maybe I think Sak I think Saka is is good but he probably he hasn't had much time to come back from preseason yeah I don't know I'm I'm what what's your lineup you got oh yeah he's yeah feels strange to Captain him but I think it's probably just the fixture yeah the vice is not set for me um but yeah at the moment is is heach yeah cool all right what time is the deadline is it is it 6 o'clock tomorrow it's 6:30 so it's basically 24 hours from now I'm going to try not to I'm going to ignore my team for tonight and then see how it feels tomorrow after the press conferences yeah makes sense cool all right that was good fun yep good luck everyone hopefully hopefully we'll get big points but hopefully just me actually all right we'll be back next week to recap and see what it all went wrong or right fun all right yes all right until next time bye bye thanks everyone",9316

Kieran is here to hello Kieran how are you doing yeah all good um excited only something like eight four seven days to go or something like that so yeah yeah next Friday Friday night I think it's a good time to you know talk about preseason a little bit find out how some teams are doing um before the start of the season so it feels like it's been quite a few weeks actually since the game came out now have you been doing loads of draws I haven't done loads honestly I've been trying to just you know get some info see what people are doing in preseason and yeah there's kind of almost no point before that really just you know there could be loads of injuries and preseason and you know' seen United getting a few injuries and obviously they're not that fantasy relevant but like it happens obviously so yeah there's no point planning too much until I think um you know my last sort of drafts will be done post um Community Shield I guess yeah absolutely I'm I'm same I feel like the this this uh weekend coming we're probably going to get like the last of the preseason games with most of like let's say most Euro players and back at least in the squad yeah especially the English one so um and Spanish one so yeah I think there's still a lot up in the air so should we have a talk a little bit about what we have seen in preseason so far and um yeah go a little bit from there before our show next week yep let's do it all right do you want to kick us kick us off of um yeah so we're just gonna go through kind of like some of the teams have interested in us and a few of the players in each of those teams so um yeah Spurs I'll start with um yeah interesting start of the season with um Lester away and then Everton at home in the first two those two look like games that you can Target and then if you possibly want to move off them because after that they got Newcastle away Arsenal at home which is obviously tough but yeah you know possibly you know lond Derby sometimes delivers goals at least um so yeah their former preseason though has been has been really good they've won every single game but they've conceded um I think he is one two three yeah so six goals or seven goals actually sorry um in the in the preseason well so obviously the defense has been shaky even though I think they've had most of their starters I think Romero hasn't played but that's roughly about it I think van has played a couple I'm not sure exactly but anyway um yeah the defense is never one we really Target unless we're looking at parro which I mean I think parro is possibly a good option um yeah maybe I'll talk about him first as phas so 5.5 million he's 28% owned which I think is possibly down to Auto pick teams still but that that is quite High um and someone I guess we should probably be aware of if if he sort of does anything in those first two we could um we could be seeing our ranks go down obviously so he's the third highest picked overall Defender actually yeah I'm quite surprised about that yeah fair enough um yeah he got three goals eight assists in last season um two goals in preseason so far so he's obviously still being given license to attack um yeah so I think he's obviously the The Pick of the 5.5 million Defenders there isn't really much around his price point um I think he'll be a decent Cash Cow if you want to go down from him after those first two if someone like Matson starts to look like he's nailed down his team in the Villa team yeah um yeah there there's places to go so I think he's possibly someone that could be good to start with and and move down from um yeah like I said I think the first two are really good for them I could see him getting a goal in you know the EV game maybe something like that so the Leicester game was probably going to be pretty open I'm not really sure how Leicester play anymore to be honest not really done enough research about they used to be attacking didn't they um in the Prem so that could be an open game um yeah um someone else I was looking at like sun um 10 million he's obviously quite expensive now um did he go yeah he went up by a million didn't he he started at nine last year so um yeah he has been playing in the nine in most of the games in preseason and played you know nine most of last year um and then sometimes off the left like um so yeah there's talk about sanki isn't there now which um yeah is obviously a bit of a concern for sun um maybe it's a bit more of concern for the people who've been playing um through the middle kesi has been playing through the middle of preseason as well a bit so um as a sort of false n sort of character and possibly like a central kind of attacking eight um so does that affect him in his game time if sanki comes in you're like they're probably not gonna buy sank and bench him you'd think he'd be the starter um so yeah I was looking at keski was him he's only 2% owned he's had a really good preseason as well he's got one goal of four assist 6 five as well it's quite in expensive five yeah he's he's in that um bracket of the 6.5 Milli mids um which is there is quite a lot of them so um yeah Johnson as well in the same team 6.52 um so it just comes down to like one of those guys is probably gonna get Miss out if sank comes in um obviously there's verer there there's Madison there still as well like there's Charon I think is still injured um but kuski yeah one goal four assist preseason like he's got good form we've had decent kind of um history of picking him early weeks haven't we and he's he's done well for us so um yeah I think a lot of people are sleeping on this this Spurs first too at least like there's definitely some points to be had there for Spurs um I think it's strange that sun is only down I'm just having a look at his ownership now down at 11.5% and that's like 11th of of all mids I mean you compare him with the other premiums from last season and you know he's right amongst it and in terms of his total goal outputs 27 attacking returns you know he's pretty much going to play every game he's he's on penalties Spurs aren obviously great for clean that extra clean sheet point but you know based on how they've changed that bonus point system as well he should see an increase in that from the the shots on Target and the fouls so true I think he's being overlooked compared to the other premiums and you're right gameweek one I expected to be an open game against Leicester he's had a good preseason too I mean I've had Sunny pretty much the D my draft for like the last two weeks and I don't really think I'm close to getting rid of him either I think he's just at a good good price this season yeah he's been in a few of mine um it's just it's if you're looking at salarin and Haren like he's pretty much impossible to pick as well if you're going that way and if you want someone like Trent as well and sort of like at least one premium Defender like he gets to that point where you're just like I can't fit him in yeah that's why I was looking at keski as like I'd love a bit of that attack um but I think you know if slanky comes then that's obviously a bit of a RIS that does change it a lot but obviously son yeah he's nailed on he's a captain um he'll play wherever I guess um less good if he's off the side maybe maybe not so um yeah I wasn't expecting you to say I haven't seen your draft so but yeah son and yours interesting yeah he's been he's been in like I say been in there for a while I do like I like him as a as a Pick 10 million it's yeah I think it's it's obviously 0. five behind Palmer I think he you know he he's a proven F player they had no manager change they've had a good preseason most of the squads together and like you say they've got a really good first couple of fixtures I think there isn't much to dislike about it and we know can be explosive he's a captain C option so yeah he's like a reliable pick I think so for me he's potentially not going to have Salah he's someone that's outperformed him like from a golden Point Golden Boot point of view a couple seasons ago uh he's definitely going to play he's yeah in a team that's not having a manager change so I think there's a a lot going for him so that's why I'm surprised that he's not more highly owned really no I can I can see the pill absolutely it's just yeah if you're not going for Salah or or something like that then then he probably is the someone you go to um if not sacka or or Palmer or whatever but um yeah it's with players and managers looking for tah and harand to start with um of just as being like I'd rather own them than not um then yeah sun is just going to be overlooked so you're the brave one I guess yeah absolutely um any more on on Spurs no let's move on okay the ones i' so the ones I've mainly wanted to chat about tonight are essentially because we don't know each team's form and going off preseason is obviously difficult it's just I've been trying to look at teams that have got good fixtures and try on paper and think about their assets so Chelsea I think bar the home game against City in game week one they've then got away against wolves Palace Bournemouth West Ham Brighton Forest so I think and then after that Liverpool but that's pretty solid run in for the first like eight game weeks there but defensive record uh defensive players I can't like see any Merit in having them they've been really poor in preseason 12 conceded in five games admittedly they've had some tough fixtures but you know they're just making such sloppy mistakes managers said about how unhappy um he is with how they're playing out from the back and I kind of think as well apart from Palmer and karella I can't really think of maybe Enzo recently and like many more first team players that they've got to come back I'd say the majority of their team are ones that you would expect to be almost first choice and yeah yeah I just don't think they've done done that um that well really the the Highlight I suppose one everyone's getting excited about is zuku because he's 6.5 million and He's listed as a a midfielder he's actually 177% ownership so he's like nearly 10% higher than sun which is is mad but he's actually like level with madek in in preseason who you know I'm not I'm not sure who who Palmer's going to play replace maybe it will will be him but M's matched him in preseason with three goals and one assist and and you wouldn't think it cuz he's owned by just 6% so I kind of feel like the name of enuka and madaki had a good end to last season as as well so kind of think he's been a little bit overlooked he's not a player I pick but I just think it's it's interesting that that balance there I think he's a bit expensive um I agree yeah if he was six and maybe in the 5.5 bracket I think he'd be talked about a lot more yeah um but yeah he probably is going to be the starter um I can't see well we don't even know what he thinks about Sterling and and Madrick who knows I guess so it probably is Jackson andu mad and Palmer as the font four no I think it's I think there's still a lot up in the air about the Chelsea team like they've had is it gu Guai the he's a five he came from Barcelona he's only playing because Jackson's not back I don't really have the love for Jackson it's a difficult one Chelsey I feel like might be saying this a lot tonight but the final preseason game will tell us about where where Palmer fits into that that team at the moment I kind of think Palmer is perhaps a bit expensive to have in my game gameweek one team despite his amazing sort of season last last year I think it's just the uncertainty of how they're playing at the moment doesn't doesn't yeah doesn't f me with confidence to make him like a a game week one pick really yeah I I think I agree um the their fixtures has given me a little bit of a Deja from last season because they had yeah the start the after like one or two bad games they had like a really good run didn't they we also have G to Jackson and doubles and possibly triples and you know they they weren't good at the start of the season but then they started to come into the r at the end didn't they but um yeah I think I think Inu is certainly gonna be a good option he's he's in my team like he you know he has the history of being a great player um and you know people are worried about his Fitness and stuff and he's said himself he's probably not 100% but he's played three 90s in a row in the preseason now so if doesn't say he's he's fit to me then I don't know what does I think he's just he's just a good pick like he he if he doesn't play 90s then whatever but he probably he probably will to be honest so I think it's fine yeah I think he'll play it looks like he'll play number 10 or or wide left I guess so yeah he's going to be he's definitely provided like a challenge to Palmer which I quite like so yeah I think that a lot of movement will happen one way or another after that City game depending on how he how he looks cuz just cuz it's the televis have you seen like there's been plenty of people on Twitter who who've got anuku and their teams and they're benching inv City would you advise that like I would do that no I feel like the the theme from last season which obviously not sure if it's going to continue this but of how like open the the big games were like Chelsea city was 44 last season I appreciate it's like a different manager but their game in preseason was high scoring as well wasn't it four was it 42 in the end so yeah I think any anything can happen on the first day of the Season teams can't quite up to speed so yeah no I wouldn't wouldn't bench him I agree um who do you want to talk about next or do you want to do Abba penalty system uh I don't mind you you talk next okay so Crystal Palace um yeah they're interesting team to everyone I think um you know the glasner effect has been genuinely spicy and they've been scoring loads of goals like he has turned them around into a decent team was like one of those teams that we're like picking from quite regularly now so um yeah their sort of preseason form has been pretty um you know mixed but they've had a one-1 draw a three a 36 win a 3-1 win and a 3-1 okay so that's not that mixed actually but they've been scoring loads of goals um their fixtures are pretty good to start as well like brenfield away West Ham a home Chelsea aways not that bad I and then Leicester at home man united at home you know man united man united now and then Everton away so the first like six those are good um obviously losing at least say is is going to be a big Miss but you know kamada from I like the look of him frankfur has come in I think he was um so yeah he looks good he's he's five another 5.5 million option um he's like an attacking CM I would say like um or possibly a 10 um so yeah he looks good um and I think he's been he's got like a goal and two assists in preseason so he's had a full preseason with him as well so he's obviously accumulated and and doing well so far so um Mata apparently is to be be back in time for game one like he's had his break pre Olympics like he didn't play in the Euros or anything like that so um yeah and he looked hot in the Olympics as well like he's done scored goals in that as well he has he has so he's been keeping up his form um and yeah they've just signed s from Watford as well is m s he used to be you know a pick in FPL as well he had his sort of moments as well so that's another depth option for them for replacing Alis so um yeah gay is possibly moving to Newcastle which is interesting but at the end of the season one of their their defenses metrics were you know I think it was around about top four and to be honest he wasn't starting most of those games because he was injured so yeah I I don't see that as an issue for the defense um yeah Henderson appears to be winning the goalkeeper role like he possibly is if he does win that um possibly the best 4.5 I think Johnson looks like he's going to go as well there was apparently he asked to leave so there's going to be a 4 5 for million pairing there which would be quite nice funnny enough I heard it apparently not in the forest oh God what interested in them SS Miguel like johnon bloody stupid Forest make weird transfers like that all the time don't they they had that vados guy and they've had so many Keepers and Turner and just I just not working for them yeah but yeah so Henderson um and whatever other he called yeah okay so that seems like a good option for um the 8.5 if that happens um and then obviously in most people's teams I would guess I don't know if he's in your team um e at 7. million yeah 33% owned already he is exactly so he's not played any minutes in preseason as far as I know um but you know we expect him to be back and playing their last preseason game for sure yeah should be the the final Cog in that the sort of team that's been looking good so far and you know he's he's had plent of games with guys already so um 11 goals five assists and 23 24 10 goals five assists in 22 23 um and this was only with around like 2,600 2,000 2,000 minutes so if he can just up that and just like stop getting injured and just get to the like 300ish minutes Mark that would be I think he's he could be one of those players that we just um you know keep in for a long time to be honest so yeah but he was he had some sort of hype at the start of last season and he was pretty was something to be wary of for sure but maybe that that was under was that under hodon then though yeah it was yeah okay so um yeah I'm I'm pretty confident in him I don't think he's going anywhere that price bracket seems good for you you can possibly go down and you can possibly get some money to to go off if you need to as well so yeah I like him and I think yeah palace defense like Anderson has had full preseason Mitchell's had full preseason um I think that're they're good picks Anderson and himself you want to if you want to go down for Munos um I've got Munos in my team at the moment I'm I like his attacking sort of metrics they all look really good um five million is another way of just possibly getting on someone like Matson as well like I said um he's just a good price point I think a five million Defender seems like a good idea to me um just to have that um 0. five in the bank if you need if you can go the luxury go down to a 4.5 or just move sideways to someone who's looking really good so yeah their defense looks good Moos looks good um possibly the double up with Henderson I mean I don't love that but the the other 4.5 keepers are not looking amazing so yeah the palace look like a good team so there's lots to like and you're right about their their fixture run at the start I think they're they're definitely a team I've the moment like like you and like you know 33% of other people have got E I think it's funny that Mata has that .5 million more even though he's not got penalties and the extra clean sheet and the extra goal point but it's just how they how they' pric yeah he he is a bit over PR I think yeah um so another team with a good start to the season I'm sure you'd agree Fulham um have a really decent looking run so after that opening game against man united which I think is is also pretty good game really like opening night swing at a team that have got a lot of defensive issues obviously um sure Martinez is going to be back but yeah other than that I imagine it'll be Evans partnering him because I think even McGuire maybe still got a little bit of a knock but is he still injured God yeah I think so but so I think you know they're worth looking at because of the good starts of the season so after that they've got three three home games in five all all decent games Leicester West Ham and Newcastle and in between that they've gotten a away game uh against zp Switch so two promoted teams in a row exactly and even after that Newcastle game they got Forest when it gets a little bit trickier after that with City away in Aston Villa but but they've done well in preseason they've played three one two they got final game coming this this weekend they've scored in every game which I and in my head I kind of think of fen from last as being like a free flowing like quite attacking team but I was surprised their XG was was not good they were in the bottom half of the table 1.3 XG per game last season so it you know Smith Rose the big money move is he going to make them that much better from an attacking point of view so I had to look at like his historical data because that's all we've got to go on obviously he's coming at 5.5 million I should say 4.5% ownership at the moment he's played less than 500 minutes total uh across his last or two like let's say full seasons when he was uh with Arsenal um which time he had 19 returns so he was averaging a return every other game um in the last preseason game he scored from the other player who is definitely of Interest which is is Robinson because there was a a heat map shown which I haven't got to hand here but Robinson was like the third highest player forward on the average position map like basically playing left wing and I think for 4.5 million he is probably the best attacking Wing back option we've got at 4.5 million so yeah very slight competition with ceson who's gone gone back there but from what I read of people who like know about Fulham it's going to be very minimal he he had two assists in preseason this is Robinson now sorry and he had six attacking returns last season small level of ownership as well with just 6% but I kind of think with with him and another 4.5 million who they rotate with someone like a palace Defender I think you get two good or you can get a very good option there and play him in three of the first five games comfortably at home and you potentially get an attacking return there yeah I quite like it what do you think of Robinson yeah I like him a lot um he's he's been in a good few of my J I think he's in my current one um yeah it's it's just whether you want to like possibly not do the rotating and just kind of save a bit money and go a bit more expensive somewhere else but I think yeah he's he's a good option and it's just these these sort of players who look good and they often just get overlooked and they just they churn over points across the season and you know if you have them the whole season something like that and they they just end up being absolutely good value um yeah he's he's gonna do well I don't see any risk with ses to be honest um obviously castan on the other side is certainly a good option too he he popped up with some consistent too they're both 4.5 so um yeah shame Leno is five absolute shame yeah that is because I think he would have been a an auto pick I think that'll be worse defensively because they miss in Paia um yes so maybe expect fewer clean fewer clean sheets than last season in terms with their other assets it's A's done well in preseason himz has done well munes has done okay one goal and one assist I think he's prob like we talked about this a little bit earlier he's probably my pick of the Six Million or or less midfielders but I feel like you choose him from a like a bunch of bad options I don't think he's he's great I think he's first choice but I expect he'll get replaced most games around like the 70th or 80th minute for him and and there is a bit of threat there yeah I know he seems a good option to start the season with because of those opening fixtures but yeah I don't know I don't feel like we've got a good third attacker spot I think there is okay option like moon is caval and and wood I think are good option like and and then like J Pedro at 5.5 I guess and then also Armstrong at southton is 5 five um I don't mind m is like think he's fine like is he's more a bit of a like a pick because of the fixtures I don't I'm not necessarily like sold on him as an option because like you know he had that purple patch and then he didn't do much else the rest of the season like is that just going to continue like it just seems a bit worrying to me but then you know if you look at someone like calv Leen who's got really good fixtures two seems to be fit in all of the preseason obviously that comes of uh risking itself with with owning him but like he's nailed on he's fixed until like game 15 are like really good he's on penalties about munz munz is not on penalties as far as we know is he Andreas is so yeah um wood is wood on penalties no don't think so I think it's yeah so out of the six millions that are on penalties that's kind learn and he's got the fixtur to do and he's he's really lowly owned so yeah just I can't trust him just because of his injury record yeah there's obviously that risk too like minutes risk for Moon is minut RIS for wood yeah possible injury X minute X injury for Cal yeah yeah yeah okay I hadn't really considered Cal L I don't know if I really want to but yeah the penalties is a bit of a sway I think he's a good option he's he's looked perfectly fit and fine and like Everton like look better to be honest so I don't know yeah okay um all right who who should we talk about next um yeah Newcastle um okay so yeah they've got good fixtur to start as well Southampton at home is obviously looking like a prime first game week fixture um B away after that Tottenham at home yeah there's plenty goals in that game I think um and then Wolves Away fum away and then Man City home so the first six are pretty decent all Al together um yeah Isaac um I think is possibly one of the highly owned players possibly is the most 55% at the moment I'm just having to look see if there's any higher but yeah yeah so there seems to be like almost no reason to not pick him like the fixtures look so so good um yeah full preseason as well didn't do anything with Sweden Sweden weren't in the Euros um he's scoring in the preseason got three goals I believe Wilson is possibly injured again as well so not fully fit so yeah like I said he just seems to be someone you just like his numbers were great last year and there is no reason not to pick him he's he's eight eight million is that right 8.5 yeah 8.5 um yeah fairly expensive but possibly still underpriced for what he should be able to do like he I can see him breaking 20 goals if he stays fit quite easily so um yeah he's in for me 100% I assume he'll be in yours too um yeah and we saw what he did at the end of the last season like just kept scoring for fun um I got into him early had a couple of hattricks in there from him which where he was under 20% EO or something like that and yeah but you know people call on to him fast and and people are not going to miss out on him this season so I think it's own or be scared Go season yes okay so he's already broken the 20 third play um I think he's certainly a good capturing option I have the arm band on him at the moment as well um I think Southampton so I yeah Southampton probably going to be there for the taking to be honest um they were mostly a possession based team as far as I know in the efl and they're not going to be afforded that in the Premier League so um yeah I think southt a definitely be a team's Target for attack most definitely yeah no I I agree with you to be honest I think good captaincy option for game week one and then um yeah obviously Gordon is yeah not back yet fully well he's I think he's come back but he's not played in minutes as far as I know um they've got two preseason games left as far as I know um so he should start to get minutes there but he obviously will be a decent pick yeah um but then someone I'm certainly looking at um is Jacob Murphy which seems crazy but yeah five five another 5.5 million guy and not. 7% so not even 1% owned um he's had four goals three assists at preseason like that's the most form player I think anyone in the whole game um so yeah to me like for those first few like the at least the first two to Target like he seems like a great pick and I don't think almeron is is an issue no um like the only RIS risk would be Barnes um or Gordon going to the right and Barnes playing the left I I don't think they've had time to do that or they they haven't played tried to do that at all in preseason so far so obviously Gordon hasn't been there so I think that's just not a thing that's gonna happen for a while and Murphy look at his form like why would he not start the season and true he's had good whenever he plays he seems to get returns as well in in for Newcastle so like I just it just seems for me he seems to be one of those punts that you could just take with in that bracket of just looking at those fixtures and then possibly moving off to another one um yeah I like it a lot like his his form is great I didn't even realize he was near 5.5 million but you're right his attacking returns 11 last season in just over 1,100 minutes so that's nearly like a return just over every game so yeah to start the season if he looks like he's going to play that right wing I think he yeah it could be a good option four goals three assists in preseason like the man is on fire like he's he's going to be taking a lot of confidence to the season so let's just hope he doesn't like these last two he doesn't start to get benched and minutes get like then obviously I'll have to get rid but yeah um at the moment I'm I'm certainly looking at that oh cool yeah I like that pick to be honest about him yeah and then defense there was talk of trivia leaving but it doesn't seem like that's gonna happen um so I guess he's only just got back so does that mean he'll start the season who knows like he is pretty old now isn't he but um Hall has looked good leis Hall I think he's Le it is yeah yeah um he's looked really good um whenever he has played um but like people are saying he will play the left back role and then livero is possibly going to play the right back role um and then there's burn like is burn going to start the season don't know at Center back probably I would guess um because I think B's still out so sh and burn I guess unless and then it's probably sha and gayi if he comes in but then where's burn gonna go because he was he was Captain when he was a few times when Tri is out so he could have lost this bur G be left on the bench like I don't know um he is reliable of course like he's a good sort of just like journey man for them to just be across the pitch and so yeah I think he he was a good pick when we thought trapo was leaving and but burn just like liment in a hall like I think they all W aren they yeah there just um I think I think they're too risky to pick I think Pope the five million could be okay like fine like I think their defense is going to be good still so yeah um he's certainly not going to lose his face so um yeah I I think there's there's points in the Newcastle defense but I think who you pick is is just really tough unfortun yeah same I'm for me on their defense it's like a wait and see like if I have a look at the fixtures over the first first few like Southampton yes Bournemouth away probably not Spurs at home maybe Wolves Away F away probably not probably not then City at home probably not so yeah there's maybe like one or two clean sheets there in the first even up to Everton yeah I don't know I feel like a 4.5 rotation would work for me I'm not would back in the away games yeah yeah I agree yeah um all right another team for to um talk about who who've got really solid starts of the season and and but I would say their ownership is not like related to that is is Forest um like the highest own player is still Morgan Gibbs Morgan Gibbs white and he's only on 7% if you take a look at their fixtures um basically up until well I've got quite a lot of them on the screen now but let's just start they start home against Bournemouth Southampton wolves they got the trickier away game against Liverpool but then they got Brighton Fulham Chelsea Way which like we said we don't expect at the moment based on Chelsea form is going to be be tough but that's in October so maybe things will change then Palace Leicester West Ham Newcastle so I think that're they've got like a nice run of of fixtures to start the season nothing too too scary and off the back of last season with with Nuno in charge they were really they were really well drilled from a defensive point of view they had a great XGC last season average XGC of just 1.4 per game which was the fourth best on average uh in the league so they could be a sensible investment with most of their defensive line of 4.5 million and like we talked about a little bit earlier their goalkeeper line looks like it's going to be as well um they've done well in preseason they've played five one three drawn one and lost one they've kept two clean sheets in that time which you know kind of bodess bodess well um yeah the fixtures are good the ownership is low there's probably a few picks from each position so AA I guess that's how you pronounce that it's Justa AA who who plays left back um he came into the team in the Midway point of last season was getting forward quite well in preseason some notes I read looked like he was he was combining well with Cam hon ad doy on that side we still got Nico Williams there 4.5 the defensive line like B Millo tofo like there's players there at 4.5 million who can rotate admittedly their numbers from last season overall were poor but I think if you're going to take a chance on them to start of the season is good up up front I'll switch switch there wood is is interesting I like felt like I've heard that aoni is is not back from injury for maybe like three or four weeks into the new season or he's going to be challenging his minutes so it looks like it's it's Woods Place to Start he actually scored 14 goals last season in just 108 minutes like most do the team create for him he's basically fixed in that the penalty area and Al Langer and Callum Huds and AD doya and as well as Gibbs white a chief suppliers and on them it's no surprise there with the top three points scoring midfielders last season Gibbs white looks have lost Corners he's still on penalties alanga from whatever is the most prone to rotation of the three of them and Hudson Ado slightly more goal threat they all finish similar I think maybe there's a as a punt in there for the start of the season I don't really like any any one more than the others but yeah I think I had that CH like Hudson got like it was somewhere like six goals or something from like 1.5 XG or something like that so it was like a massive over performance of like his um his goals to XG ratio so um I there's something about Forest I just don't love like I don't know like I don't know what it is like I just can't trust them um I had a in a couple of my drafts and I just I just look at it and I was like why why am I going there yeah literally why when there's like good def you know you could get a Totten Defender for 4.5 in in vaner ven I thinking you can get Man United Center backs Newcastle Villa I just think they're all teams are going to be the top end of the table and yeah you don't really want to mess around transferring your 4.5 million Defenders but I feel like you could be with with them but they've got good fixtures so if you're playing an early wild card there's a you know there's maybe a potential advantage in in having one from the start yes yeah no I agree I think I think wood is good as well like you said like he probably is the guy that's like not injury prone yeah and out those play and probably gonna start most of them at least um so I don't know like I just just don't like don't trust them no no saying they're a bit bit mixed all right who should we talk about now we got one one more team before we talk about maybe our drafts uh yeah i' got one more team and then a couple notable mentions to as well so um so man city I I mean I guess we'll talk about them like their fixtures are good um the start of the Season obviously Chelsea I think is still a good fixture like Holland scored a hattick in preseason against them um 44 as well in that one of the games in the league last season like if Switched At Home obviously great fixture um and then West Ham brenford Arsenal newc like yeah they're fine um yeah so the preseason formed like a 42 win a two a 3-2 loss A two- two draw and a 3-4 loss so they've had some mixed preseason but you know most if not like three quarters of their starters have been out and like not back yet so um yeah not list looking at that too much and they're still scoring four against a almost full strength Chelsea team so um yeah there's that um like people are talking about Bob like a lot at five million and like I'm not solding this at all like um he's supposedly um like the number one backup to Harem now which seems kind of crazy um like Alvarez is obviously gone yeah um yeah he can play across all of the sort of front three or four apparently um but like you know there's still Bernard Silvera there's still doku there's still greish there's still um BL who else is that like um Savio guy that's just going de bruy yeah foden um nun greish nun yeah yeah there's so there's so many options still even though they've just got rid of Alvarez that like Bob is still a fringe player for me like maybe he will start the first game or something like but I don't know just like pass that I think this it's pretty unlikely to be honest but two goals three three assists in preseason sure he's playing that's what literally what preseason is for for these Fring of players to play so maybe he's just playing those games because that's literally what The Fringe and preseason before isn't it like those Fringe players get games to try and improve themselves and and obviously he's been doing well but um for me it's just it just seems too risky I'm I'm not gonna go there I think we'll see probably a close to first team in the community Shield um and I guess we'll take it from there if he looks like he's stting that and scores like two goals then you know maybe he'll be an option but for now not for me um yeah there's there's no nailed on player in the city team we've always said that like even the wide wide players like if you just have a look at the minutes from previous season like Roder who's like their most consistent player has still played like 300 minutes less foden was their highest scoring player last season just played 2,800 out of about 3,200 minutes so there's yeah there's always a none of their even their Defenders like Walker played the most minutes 2,700 next was Ruben with 2,500 so they're not we know this they're not na the goalkeeper don't play them all yeah they're not you're never going to get like a you know a player that's going to start all 38 games harand might I mean I think I think vario is close like after his season last year like I think he he should start I think he'll start games kind of like canel when he was the first choice and just like he was just the second player who you could pretty much rely on for just playing all the time yeah whereas I think gardio is possibly that now um yeah he's been playing Center back during preseason like I think he's played two of the four he got an assist as well I saw he did get an assist from Center back as well so um but he's only been playing Center back because they basically got no Defenders yeah at the moment so fair enough um yeah harand scored five goals in preseason um he's 41% when I made the uh notes he's probably higher than that I imagine by now um yeah scored a hatrick against his game at one appointment in Chelsea the other day and they had a good back four um obviously pep said he had muscular niggles which we have heard him have before but he played the next game scored three so assume he'll play the community shield and just assume from there he'll be absolutely fine yeah 42% ownership you're right I did we did a check when we first the game first launched and it was 30 so he hasn't gone up as much as I I would have thought to be honest yeah um I just I'm just like in the opinion at the moment as like we've been discussing like sah and Har in those PHS as just being like I'll own them to start with and then I'll just see what happens I think they're safer it's it's way easier to go down from them than it is to get back up to them um I think you'll probably be committing to just not owning Salah or one of them I guess um would would you what would have to happen for you to try and get back up there don't know first wild card I don't know yeah okay yeah fair I don't which probably might happen within the first game eight game weeks I don't know I just I think making maybe it's it's not obviously remains to be seen but I think based on how much Salah is I think there's other options in secka Sun and Palmer and even foden who have done like as well as him last season and those players have now got like history and pedigree so I think when you factor in harland's price and the fact that you're probably going to Captain him most weeks that's a lot for a player who you're not going to Captain when there's going to be other players around him who was going a score similar yeah I'm kind of in the park of if I was going to go for one it would be Salah and i' get rid of Harland um right just because I think the you can have Watkins Isaac and maybe habit there just three really good Strikers that you basically don't need to change ever yeah um so that's why the season is going to be great because I think everyone's different like I when the game first launched I thought oh yeah that I could spend all that money that I don't have from Harlem but like now I just think I'm going to be wanting to Captain him most weeks over Salah I don't know I think that's why this season's going to be hopefully really like a lot of variant because it's going to people be ripping up their teams after game week one if Salah scores and harand doesn't and and maybe vice versa yeah so Salah is a notable mention I'll just go on these I guess so so um yeah he's had a full preseason with li he's looked sharp apparently he's been quoted or has been looking incredibly sharp and fit so um yeah he's been involved in I think he's got I haven't got his actual numbers down but I think he's got few assists a couple goals um and yeah salah's looking good I guess like he's got a shaved head now as people are saying that he's so he's um he's got his mojo back he's serious he's ready to get the the Golden Boot and all that stuff so um yeah another season of Salah he you know he does look super like you see with his shirt off and he looks um like a goddess God not godess and they've got good pictures as well to start the season haven't they pool fixes are great yes so um there is that as well like just looking at the fixtures and I had to look at Salah and I'm just like how can I not go there like it seems crazy like on penal still like maybe he'll lose them but probably unlikely he's just yeah and and then there's Trent like I would love to own Trent like I really I think those fixures are so good yeah especially for him for attacking wise like is there going to be many clean sheets not sure but um yeah we're not sure how good slots defense is I suppose but um yeah maybe maybe Trent's a bit of a risk to start with because he's not had any minutes but um and Bradley is obviously a good um replacement of make weight yeah so but but yeah Salah i' I'd like to have J I think J is a good option I think he started the last two preseason games and he's got a good few returns in them as well I think he got um what we got down there yeah he started two of the last four um uh yeah two assists against man united in the last one so when they scored when they won three nil so um and he missed a golden chance as well so he's obviously getting the positions and he always does well when Jos start so um but obviously if he gets a start in the first week that doesn't mean he's gonna start the next week so um there is still all that rif um rotation there with just Zas J gapco Nunes Diaz salah's the only one that's gonna stay Elliot is looking like he should be pushing for the St Jones they want to sign someone as well don't they from real Saad I forget what his name is yeah zubu meny or something oh yeah that's him yeah yeah so so yeah like Salah I think I know you're worrying me about not having Salah but well you were worrying me about son earlier so you know that's true that's true um and then just like Havoc I guess is the other just noticeable imine I was going to say like eight million forward I still think he's a great option he he the last game against lus the last um friendly it looked like mostly a um sort of first team other than possibly sacka who played did play the second half got 45 men but yeah havit um he played sort of left mid in a three but he was like super going forward still he was like perfectly fine to get he was in the Box quite a lot still um and yeah he Jesus started so Jesus's fit which is obviously a worry for his minutes but at the same time so he could be playing a reverse out opposition role which is obviously not great yeah but at the same time Jesus went off and have it stayed on like I think that's going to happen all the time and he got lots of goals at the end of last season of just like staying on the pitch of just playing 90 minutes which he he was do I think he got 30 starts out or something like that last season so um yeah I I think he's he's a good option I Think Jesus is not going to stay fit I think havit was he absolutely the starting Striker still to to to me anyway um and I yeah he's he's in my team at the moment I think so I can't even remember what I sent you but I I think he's a great option still um people are worried about Jesus Min and I just don't think it's is that much of an issue they played so well with him to close out the season lot last year and he his attacking returns were great like 23 across the season if he continued that that rate for like a full season he only had he missed like eight games essentially where he only had 30 starts so yeah he got 180 points was he listed is a Midfield though last season he was a Midfield year that's right so he would lose you know fair amount of points there but no I still I think he's going to be good pick and he's he's he's definitely a decision because he's two point uh 2.5 million less than sacka yeah and he's like you know we saw an 8 million forward last year in Watkins um who just smashed it out the park and he didn't have penalties or anything or any set pieces or anything like that so you know hav is sort of in that mild and he just looks like he's almost int integral to that team now I don't think he's he's going anyway um right let's have a look at our teams we've got about six minutes so do a short wrap up on our team so let let's do my my team first because I've have at least seen yours you can still be shocked by I I'll read it out where we are at the moment so 343 um 4.5 million goalkeeper in fleen backup just the the Bren brenford backup at the moment I've gone crazy in defense I've got CBA porro and gardial so I've basically gone for some big hitters across the back backline with 2 4.0 GPS in Bednar and and Johnson um Midfield I've got Sun sacka e and Rogers and then up front harand isach and munz so I think it's you know it looks like an okay I think the biggest pain points at the moment to try and make a a team are definitely like the right hand side of the screen so gardial could easily be two 4.5 rotating players Rogers is a bit of an unknown for me he's been playing really well in preseason and and like you know the word is he's going to basically be playing number 10 behind Watkins so I kind of feel like at 5 million he could be a game breaker if he has a good start to the season their fixures are okay and munes like we talked about I'm still not sure about how good Fulham actually are and how good he actually is but I think I prefer him to Wood and they've got decent fixtures including that man united game so yeah yeah I think it's like I say I'm happy with the majority of it I think porro seems good for the the first two I think I've got a lot of money in defense maybe it's too much so yeah that's where we are so yeah like most people don't have an Arsenal Defender where I quite like that i' had Arsenal Defender pretty much from the start I just think it seems like a good Banker clean sheets in game weeks one and three and their defense was so good last season are they really going to fall off and when they're the same prices City Gardia let's say and you know CBA in mind is going to play every minute it just seems like someone I'm not going to get rid of they're going to get clean sheets he might get an attacking return or two he might get occasional bonus so I don't know it just seems like a maybe it's a bit of a thoughtless pick do you know what I mean like maybe I should be looking at other options but I like the security of it really so if you were going to downgrade one it wouldn't be no it would probably be vardal to be honest yeah interesting because I have V in my team and I don't I don't have sver so yeah I should probably look at Arsenal defense more I don't know I just I just can't see them like I feel like they should drop off at least a bit like that that was just just a really crazy performance of just Queen sheets last year I just don't know if that's going to continue and CA is obviously gonna be nailed but he's like he's a bit boring compared to you know most other picks I guess but the reason yeah but he's got like the other ones have got threat that's my thought now especially with that calori coming in like yeah exactly there may be more rotation Maybe arteta is planning more like more like pep I don't think white White's a funny price at 6.5 million yeah because there isn't like a another and I don't know about backing Liverpool Defenders yet even though their fixtures are good I don't know what you know because primarily I'm thinking about the clean sheet so yeah celba has been in from the start and I don't know I don't really want to change that now because I I feel like that's wouldn't be my decision do you know I mean yeah I think that makes sense I'm certainly going to need to look at Arsenal a bit more I I yeah just the just the reliability of them makes sense but at the same time you could possibly wait to them until like I think it's um trying to get the fixures up here I think it's game six yeah when they start to get like really good where you can just have you w card around there you got Leicester home Southampton home Bournemouth away you got Liverpool are mixed at the start admittedly yeah but they got three home games in the first six which you'd expect potential clean sheets wolves Brighton and Leicester and um yeah just I don't know six million for their def for a defender of theirs doesn't seem too bad but you've got me worried about not having Salah to be honest so but I I don't know I like I like Suns for the first two fixtures I always like sacka even though he's not super exciting and I feel like there's three captaincy options there we taking your team as well yes so I was quite there's some nice names in here when I looked at this this morning Barco I liked I wasn't expecting and your midfielder from Spurs I liked as well yeah um so yeah I've got flecken and the Vlad morass guy um at the moment like that could be anyone any 4.5 right now like I'm really not sure which keeper I'll go with um yeah Munos is in there like I absolutely think he's going to stay um he's going to be in NORAD Drass I hope and anyway um yeah I've got bco in there's just a 4.0 starting at the moment just because I think that it's a better fixture he's on set pieces um so I think it's a better fixtion than West Ham away and away for to Robinson and coner so um I'm happy with him starting he he supposedly was injured for a bit apparently it was just a precaution he's just he's fine um so he should be starting the season with esion out um and yeah I think most people are not going to play him and I'm hoping if I play him he's gonna get like sort of an assist for Corner possibly clean sheet who knows in that game like Everton aren't that great attacking Al so um yeah I think that's possibility um I've got V in there at the moment um you know the talk about Arsenal defense is is certainly interesting um so let's see how long that lasts I suppose um yeah I I do own Salah and and Harland um yeah so the Midfield is s e Jacob M at the moment and kungu um interesting you didn't have in conu which is a surprise just don't yeah just the way I've structured the the squad really just a fan sacker or I feel like two premiums in Midfield but yeah no I quite like you know don't get me wrong I don't dislike anduku either I think it's just a different way the team structured yeah so I and then my front three is is havit at the moment Isaac captain and and Harland um and then the bench is that bergal um from Spurs um supposedly he's he's probably not going to start straight St away but he's he's going to be knocking on the door as just a center mid um sort of possibly an eight um and he's he just looks he's looked good in preseason I think he's got possibly a goal maybe an assist or something um and all you really want from a 4.5 million Midfield is just to get some minutes and that's probably enough and like there's there's Winks but I think Winks is a 4.4 waiting to happen um whereas Berg valal you know he's got under 1% ownership and you could probably just leave him in there and hope he starts to get um I think um what's his name hyberg gon he's going to be the backup that's going to come straight into these games and he might start to start ahead of SAR as well so yeah I like him um and then I've got coner and Robinson to rotate when well not not playing Barco um they rotate really well together um and yeah they're two decent enough defenses um yeah I just I need to need to look at I I'm certainly not definitely happy with it like this is um far from on like havitz is a good pick but he's not on penalties and sort of stuff like that so and kungu not on penalties Murphy not I don't really have all that many penalty takers and stuff so um yeah there's things to think about for sure yeah definitely I think definitely after this weekend feel like we'll know no more all the teams will have played their final game and um yeah we'll have more more insight all right well should we wrap it up there and then reconvene or you've got any final thoughts sorry um um yeah I was to say just having Salah is nice to know to like not having sacker or whatever like that like is just I can get to them afterwards I guess like I can just sell salary if I want to but you know his fixtures are so good maybe I'm probably never going to want to do that this is the problem with having them both I guess at the same time yeah it's definitely it's like having Salah and that that that price point it's just like a little comfort blanket isn't it that you've got there so no I think um I can understand it and just on the five and fives like I really really want to play mte or MTA um at Brighton I think is is a great option as well like I love love what he looks like he's just been ping uper preseason um looks like he's probably gonna start ahead of a dingra apparently um which is a shame for Dinger because he's been good but um yeah M could break the game as well as you say like the the Rogers like I I want to have Rogers like that would be great but I'm just not sure if he's definitely going to play I feel like probably will but like they they had their first team out basically the other day and it was only Watkins that I could see like Ramsey played like mcin Tans all of them played so people seem to think that Ramsey will be the one that goes out and Roger stays in the team for for Watkins that is um and I'm just like I don't know Ramsey was like sort of The Golden Child of astonvilla like a couple years back wasn't he so but maybe Rogers has taken that over um I don't know I think the problem with the like the fourth or fifth Defender spot this year is because we're trying to cram so many like premium defenders in because we feel like we've got the budget it ends up being that like your fourth Defender is like is nearly a CHP I mean like you've got Murphy I've got Rogers you fourth midfielder you sorry yeah fourth midfielder like end up being a bit of a cheap so yeah maybe that'll change by next week yeah yeah it could be to spread and just get like someone you know the Gordon instead of a Murphy as the fourth you know right we'll wrap up now and then we'll we'll reconvene next week so thanks for um watching and uh yeah we'll see you next time",11488
3,TheArmbandFPL,xQVDXFka6e8,FPL PRICE CHANGES 24/25 | FIRST DRAFT | NEW RULES | FPL ARMBAND,2024-07-18T05:02:30Z,"[Music] [Music] he [Music] a [Music] [Music] hello everyone we're back the FPL armband is launching again for the 2425 season Kier and I are going to react to some prices and also the exciting news that the game launched just a few hours ago we're all locked and loaded and ready to go aren't we uh yeah first draft done and nailed in until August at least so there we go yeah I'm not going to make any change till after the community shield now just going to loog out leave it yeah we'll we'll be uh all good so um on today's show we're just going to pick apart the new rules of which there's a couple um talk a little bit about price differences or price changes and then I put together a draft earlier because you know I thought that might be fun and uh we'll just have a look at that so what would you want to kick off with do you want to talk about price changes or do you want to go new rules um I guess we go over rules first I think that makes sense yeah okay what what did you think about them first of all do you think that like all right uh yeah I mean I the the five transfer thing came out of kind of nowhere I don't think anyone was expecting that um but I think it should be good for the game um yeah I think I mean yeah I just like I don't really know yet like it's no other games really do this I've gone up to five transfers as far as I know and I guess it's just going to be sort of a a wait and see how this works out really um sort of it might lead to people being a bit more cautious um but at the same time you could probably take one week punts if you've got a few transfers sort of um lined up where you could just take one person in and then just take them back out again if if you if you want to um that could be really good for someone who's in the middle of a bad fixture run and they've got one really like juicy game in the middle then you know that could be ideal so um yeah I'm I'm looking forward to it um the the sort of thing of people or transfers being saved after chips is is great too so yeah yeah what do you reckon I think that's that's the The crucial bit really I think that's where the strategy is going to come in cuz I don't I think you did it maybe once or twice last year but I definitely didn't ever get to a situation where I had two free transfers and then I would not I feel like because FPL is so quick natured with the turnarounds it almost feels like you're making a switch every week yeah they maybe they missed an opportunity to saying you could have two transfers per week and you could stack up to four or something that might have been quite interesting but yeah it's just um maybe that's quite a big big leap really but yeah stack in five so I had to think about how it was is going to affect the strategy so I think the one of the key things which they actually also mentioned in the sort of analysis was if you can obviously save up to five transfers let's say you you wild card ahead of a bench boost and then you've after the bench boost you've still got your five transfers left you can essentially swap your whole bench out and reinvest that money in your first 11 which seemed like you know a good move but that's quite a lot of if spots and maybe to go into that so yeah it'll be interesting to see how many times we actually end up getting past two transfers me personally I can't see it very much yeah I think they mentioned um the uh the gamei one bench boost strategy um but like with a bit with you know you but then again I guess you don't have five free transfers to start with do so I don't see how that really work but but yeah um that does seem like a good use of it for sure um but you you're just gonna have to plan longer ahead make sure you keep players for for runs like for a while and then you you identify them early so you can get them obviously and then you have those five free transfers if that's what you want to do yeah it wasn't yeah I'll wait and see really and I think yeah see how the season goes I mean they even started speculating on the FPL blog that between game weeks 33 and 34 there could be a a double game week followed by a blank game week because of how the FA Cup will fall this season and they already speculated that that's when you might use a a bench boost and then you'd need to use a free hit afterwards and that's where your transfer would come in but that's like so far down the the line it yeah remains to be seen whether it's actually going to be an issue or something to consider um why do you think they chose five over like three or four or like why do you think five was a reason I'm guessing they're like pitching it towards like maybe a it's almost like a mini wild card but you know five game weeks of a season is fairly high percentage isn't it it's near like what 10 10% of the season so yeah I think it's it's quite high and it sort of leads on a little bit into the mystery chip I know we've got absolutely no idea what that could be and I I think it's almost a bit of a cop out that they haven't said what it is because that doesn't really help you your strategy planning with five transfer triple Captain bench boo so well they said they will tell us like a few weeks or whatever before it's like ready to be announced so so we can plan from then but still um yeah yeah like you said I don't particularly like them not telling us it seems strange maybe because they don't even know what it is yet who knows I'm sure they do but I think it's just a bit strange to not not talk about it so yeah the mystery chip I I think you know interesting but let's let's wait and see and the only other thing uh new rule wise is the changes to the point scoring so the headline ones are it's mainly bonus Point changes um and the the score the only scoring Point difference is the goalkeeper scoring a goal that's increased from 6 to 10 I mean that's probably because the unlikely I think the last goalkeeper do it was Allison against West Brom so I don't know if we've even had one for two seasons so I kind of feel like that's almost like a non a non-issue point pretty much um the main bonus point was I thought it was a bit harsh that saving a penalty has been reduced in sort of meaning um ESS because I think that's like the the best thing you can do as a goalkeeper and then just to lose three points off like three bonus points off the back of it kind of sucks so yeah yeah I guess it almost like when they saved a penalty in a game where there were even was a few like quite a few goals scored they basically always guarant they'd get exactly bonus points but like at the same time if the player in that game has scored like two goals as well or something and then the keepers just saved a penalty um should they get three three bonus for that I don't really know no I I know I think it's it's a difficult one they've obviously tried to you know I'm kind of pleased in a way when I first saw I was like oh this is all a bit inconsequential but now I think it might actually make you know a little a little bit of difference which might be enough to I think I don't know if you read it the same way but it's almost like they're just trying to balance everything I think because the differences to do with the shots on Target and the foul one fouls being one have like increased in in Merit and goalkeepers and defending Defenders conceding a goal will be worth minus four bonus points and a goal line clearance be worth three bonus points it's almost like they've thought of ways to to sort of balance the Defenders and Strikers yeah it's a kind of a way of like giving us like extra points but um but not at the same time like they're kind of trying to put the extra point like gains like just within the bonus point system which doesn't really make sense to me um you know everyone was clamoring for bull recoveries um I think it would have been a great addition um I don't see why you wouldn't do it it just it just makes like almost you know there's probably like 60% or 70% of the players that we could pick in FPL are just completely useless there's probably a a pool of like yeah 30% of players maybe even less than that that people will pick from and then just all those others of cdms and and like just center backs from all the terrible teams are just they're never ever going to get picked and that ball recoveries especially in sort of like a team uh down the bottom of the league would have been a big thing to include and we could have started to pick from them possibly but um yeah obviously we live in Hope For That in another season maybe but it's probably never going happen is it no I know I know yeah I I agree I just think when I saw rodri's price increase and and Rice's price increase I kind of thought oh this might actually be happening and and now now that it's not and almost like fairer pricing for Defenders like we just talked a minute ago off stream that we're both kind of surprised that Arsenal Defenders aren't slightly like 0. five or so more expensive and maybe that was to try and bring the balance into having another route for them to score score points so yeah perhaps it's a opportunity um just finally on the the points scoring I had a quick look at um well saw some statistics posted about the shots on targets clean sheets and and winning fouls and interestingly from a defense point of view is is mainly that The Usual Suspects who seem to just do well on that as well so gardial van dijk porro and Trent so four probably of the most attacking defenders in in the league look like they're just going to find even more ways to scrape bonus uh so yeah definitely something to to consider because they're all kind of considered premium picks and um we've seen some prices from some players which mean we might have budget available to have more premium players in our team yeah who were the kind of most P blade players to take the most shots all the time like I guess harem was probably up there then but yeah that it was it was Usual Suspects really Harland Salah foden Watkins Darwin Palmer Isaac and Bruno were the top eight that I um Bruno sliding in there is bit surprising oh yeah I was quite surprised at that as well and the fact that he's did he stay I think he stayed the same didn't he 8. so I mean United looked like their their strengthening depends what his role is but yeah he he did surprise me in there because the other ones I suppose part apart from Darwin all had you know Good Seasons that we already know about so the fact that Bruno was was in there yeah did um did come a bit of a surprise so should we move on and chat about price changes a little bit go for it who where do you want to where do you want to start should we start by talking about Harlem because he's the yeah the big one the big one right here we go um well I suppose the main first question is when you saw the the price did you think that seemed fair or good considering he wasn't the um top scorer last year yeah um that probably isn't fair really 15 like is he well ahead of what H re was and all that stuff and and back in the day um probably I mean I guess in terms of goals maybe but um yeah 15 million to me seems harsh maybe 14.5 would have been Fair um but yeah it's just going to lead to him becoming maybe almost like a differential guys because most of people on Twitter and things I've seen most people building teams without because it just yeah you get so many so much worth of like two players or good two good players compared to like Harland a 15 so it's just it's going to be um ramped up even more with the talk of um all that sort of thing last year which was already a thing and it's gonna be even more so this year and yeah if you go for him like he's had a whole summer off hasn't he like he's not played basically at all and um so yeah arrested Harland I think their first fixtures pretty good isn't it Chelsea Way like ifs Richard home after that are you going to like not own him for that like I've got his seems risky yeah I've got his fixtures up on the screen now and obviously they're just using the FDR from the fantasy website is always going to make City's fix just look green but you're right Chelsea away which he hauled in last season he got like 17 or 18 pointer ipswitch West Ham brenford then Arsenal at home Newcastle away is perhaps the only tricky game then full and wolf Southampton Bourn so you know they've got a a pretty pretty good run to start season yeah I don't think Chelsea is bad and so the first four seemed pretty good don't they AB Arsenal home I think they beat them one nil I think he probably blanked didn't he um and then Newcastle away I don't think he's too bad and then yeah from seven to 11 that seems great as well so um but you know all these fixtures all these free transfers whatever like he you may be able to go on and off him um so that could be an option too so I think you probably start the season with him and then maybe move off him off Arsenal Newcastle and then move back on something like that it's interesting that he's already I'm just having look at his percentage for the first time so obviously I would say that most of the people that have signed up already are going to be people who are obviously taking it quite seriously and look out for the start of the start of the game and he's third third picked overall who's got probably likes by now i' guess oh no third pick Striker so he's only down at 30% Isaac and Watkins over 50% Palmer's the highest pick mid at 45% so yeah he's actually I thought that was going to be third overall but yeah third of all Strikers at the moment so yeah interesting yeah I'm you know looking at him I think probably the way I would structure my team is I'd have like either or him or Salah for like a price price point point of view and I just think 15 mil is just such a a huge amount of budget that you could potentially spread around your your team and as we get closer to the season we'll start to know more about which players are going to be favored in in certain positions and preseason form and all that sort of thing and it might be that you know salah's not that good under slot or Palmer's not good under Chelsea new manager they're playing different so true we know the thing we know about harand is he's going to yeah how he's going to play and where he's going to play and I don't think he has much risk from competition or like rotation certainly they on yeah so yeah it's definitely as soon as the season gets closer I'm sure his ownership will creep up with me especially being worried but at the moment I'm thinking I I won't have him to start the season would be my initial thing just because he's he's so expensive so so after he scored like a goal and assist versus Chelsea and he's got a switch home gameing two I'd be really worried you doing but I I I think you'd have to hold firm I think if you're going to if you're going to go without him at that price I think you have to be quite convinced that you could probably have have two or three premium midfielders and maybe one or two premium Defenders and You' kind of think that spread a budget would be good enough to cover any of his halls I think we we saw this at the start the launch of last year um loads of people didn't own him but weren't going for him and then as soon as it starts to creep up towards the actual start yeah the fear will start to kick in and then his ownership will go up to around roughly 70% at least I would imagine yeah I know yeah we'll see I guess how we're about a month out aren't we so we've got you know a long time to think about it so yeah definitely hold this thought and then see where I am in about a month's time um who who else interest you that in prices wise or who sort of like was your other top surprises in terms of um pric I mean I guess Watkins are probably I guess it's fair price I would say like 9 million um I think he was what eight or 8.5 last year um so obviously he's got a price hike obviously had his best season of his career um yeah his fixtures are pretty good at the start as well like West Ham away I think that was right yeah yeah and then Arsenal at home Leicester away Everton at home Wolves at home and then it switch away in the first six so those are good fixtures I think he's gonna be in most people's teams um yeah I mean scoring for England obviously to take him to the final um I feel like he he should should push on um yeah the fixture is there for him to do it um yeah we just need to see him possibly be consistent and just keep doing it over and over and over again and like and then he should become one of the the Premier League greats to be honest if he can keep doing it yeah um yeah because yeah third High highest scoring player last year with 228 points so obviously really good um highest scoring forward and he beat harand by like 11 points last year um yeah Douglas Luiz leaving to Juventus I think is a big loss in terms of like creativity um it's like setpiece quality and things like that um so I think that will affect him I think Anana has gone from Everton to Villa which I don't think is anywhere near close to the creativity replacement so's leaving as well did you see that he's going to Saudi Arabia as well yeah I don't know if that's confirmed but I think yeah it sounds like it will be um so yeah that's interesting too that makes um Bailey I think possibly a really good value pick in that that Villa team um because should assumably be kned on they're probably going to need to buy someone I would I would guess um if Bailey's going as well um because because who's gonna play maybe that um guy from the Italian gu Zolo I think he's called yeah maybe he'll start to play more but I don't know he was pretty bad last year there's that Rogers guy who was playing a lot towards the end of the season will probably play a bit as well yeah he's like a five million mid so and he I think he was like basically nailed on at the end of the season and he scored a couple goals got a few assists so he could be really good value too um but yeah Watkins um they've got Champions League to contend with as well so they're gonna have to increase size as well yes um yeah is he do you think he he'll take penalties is there any chance of that happening with dou he's gone maybe I mean that would be such a a huge like Clincher having him um sure because I think po many like most of the people last season who didn't get on him at the start of the Season were ones that oh he hasn't got penalties and it's a you know for 8 million he should be having penalties but now he's 9 million and it's almost like he's an an auto pick so yeah if he gets if he gets penalties that's great and I think you know he's so important to vill I'm just having a look at his his previous season so last two he started 37 of 38 and then 36 of of 38 interestingly his XG across the two seasons has been pretty consistent 6.1 season before last and last season 16.7 it was just last season is his output bumped up loads because of the number of assists he got so I imagine he'll be em number one Em's like managed European campaigns before so I'm sure Watkins won't be too affected by the additional additional games so yeah he's he's good again he's good and he's another option when you look at harland's price of 15 and and Watkins was able to do something similar last season I don't think personally I don't think similar he beat him yeah oh sorry yeah yeah but with more more minutes by quite a lot it's like 500 more minutes here um yeah I don't know I just can you see him hitting the same highs as last season I'm a bit unsure about that to be honest yeah I'd expected a a possible regression especially in this the assist numbers so yeah let's say he goes down to you know maybe like 15 goals 10 assists still not too bad from from a 9 million Striker um you know the strikers in this game are pretty Limited in terms of picks to be honest so um I think he's going to be nailed in most teams to be honest especially with the start of the fixtures and um yeah 19 goals 18 assists last year versus harland's 27 goals and eight assists and obviously the 500 minutes different made a difference 27 goals seems crazy um beasty so yeah exactly um yeah his stats he was like fifth fourth fourth and fifth for like XG XA shots and big chances so like that to me says like he wasn't performing at you know the third best overall player in the game really in terms of stats and in terms of numbers so maybe you got a bit lucky um so yeah it says to me a little bit of regression um and like I said Bailey at 6.5 6.5 million 10 goals 11 assists he only played um 18 18 games last seon with more than 60 minutes so um assumably if they're getting rid of Bailey or uh yeah Bailey no what's he called um you Bailey I think you are aren't you yeah what's the other guy um that villal I'm totally Doug the guy that's dii that's one completely forgot his name yeah so if he's leaving then then Bailey should be nailed on um yeah really good value um fix is good possibly a double up maybe um yeah I'll certainly be looking at him um there seems assumably if he's going to get the minutes then there seems to be no reason to overlook him for sure yeah no it's a surpris he's coming because he was like in favor he got 20 return I'm just having a look at Bailey now he had 20 returns last season only 2,000 minutes 148 points I mean if he keeping up that like ratio remember him being on Corners as well and yeah you could see him having a season where he gets to 170 180 points quite quite comfortably um yeah that's that's good valy for 6.5 yeah almost like the Anthony Gordon of um last season potentially sure yeah um yeah I'm talking of Gordon he's gone up and should we talk about Newcastle assets a little bit I just um they've got quite a decent um start to the season as well and where's Gordon here and isak's just come in so so hot like I think he's the is he the highest picked yeah he the highest pick forward 57% near enough of people who have all signed up have um have picked him and their their starting run is it's pretty decent it's Southampton at home bouth away Spurs home Wolves Away Fulham away so first five game weeks pretty good and yeah even with City in game week six at home you'd kind of fancy Newcastle to do well based on how good just they were at home last season so I think if he's if he retains his Fitness it seems I had another thing that Wilson is still injured and won't even be back for the start of the season I don't know if that was is that right I read a tweet about that so you know might be wrong but yeah I think he would it' be hard for him to not be in my team in game week one like a home a fixture against a promoted side in game week one and then some good fixtures to follow after that like Spurs at home Spurs abely capitulated didn't they as like like at the end of last season and then around that games against Bournemouth wolves and Fulham um yeah I think they they sound good to be honest what what's your thoughts on isack at 8.5 million yeah I I got into him quite early at the end of last season um he was a really good differentials the end got a couple of I think hatrick out of him and some some holes before he got really big own ownership um so yeah I think he's he's going to start probably around the 30 30th per ownership I would guess I think a lot of people going to go there um and if Wilson is not an an issue for minutes then yeah great um definitely going to be a good pick um I think their defense is interesting as well um yeah I I've I've noted down burn here but I think people are talking like they signed Lloyd Kelly from Bournemouth so he's possibly GNA be like the left Center back is um but they still have botman um who I think is still injured so um there's there's possible worry around burn um I think h started to play games towards the end of the season but obviously burn was playing Center back at that point so um yeah Burns I I thought you know probably would be nailed on in the team but but maybe not but at the same time he was sort of Captain towards the end of the season too so um yeah is in interesting like 4.5 million like trivia six million sh at 5.5 but botman came at 4.5 which is surprised me a little bit but um injury yeah Pope's at five um I guess Hall is probably at 4.5 as well so livero I guess is probably at 4.52 so um yeah there's a few Defenders but I guess we're going to need to see who's actually going to be nailed on in that team um whichever 4.5 million starting Defender is um G to be playing then they're going to be definitely good value um because one of them will make it in there won't there yeah for sure well maybe even two two of them because there's only two Newcastle Defenders who are worth more than 4.5 million anyway yes true so they should have yeah so we should have definitely have at least will definitely play sh will definitely play then it's it's any of the others probably not botman at the moment then maybe it's Kelly and then maybe it's possibly so yeah but it seems a shame to be benching liento and and Hall again because they're young players but they've been good when they have played they deserve to have some time so I don't know um maybe one to just keep an eye on preseason for them but um yeah trip get six possibly good value if he can St fit sh at 5.5 maybe too expensive I don't know um he was getting really far forward with Switzerland um in the Euros um and obviously he has um sort of history of scoring lots of goals for for Newcastle so he he could be right at some point um yeah there there's value in that defense for sure I think the reason trippy has been killed a little bit is because CBA and gardial are both the same price and I don't you know don't they had a huge drop off in of number of clean sheets last season Newcastle probably because of Pope's injury as well as botman and the cells and they were all injured but yeah when you can pick up guardal or CBA in teams who you'd expect to be in the top two top three at worst this season when you see tripier at six it kind of feels a bit Yeah his numbers sort of dipped off after his injury as well didn't they so he wasn't getting many like assists and things um but yeah there's there's some really good rotations for 4.5 Defenders so um with Robinson from Fulham 4.5 million he got a few assists and goals last year um so this is not too bad and it would get you Southampton at home Lester at home if switch away West Ham wolves West Ham at home Wolves Away uh Fulham away SL Newcastle at home so you'll probably play um the burn one I think is there and then not in and Forest away so that's not bad for that run um and then burm of consa gets you 17 game weeks of amazing fixture so it's like Southampton home Bournemouth I'm not I'll just name them out I'm not going to say who's a home away but Southampton Bournemouth Leicester Everton wolves if switch Everton Brighton Bournemouth tottenham's the only bad one there Crystal Palace or West Ham Crystal Palace away and then brenford Southampton Leicester ifs switch like that's that's no bad teams apart from totenham in one week of like 17 game weeks so that's burn and conza um or whatever 4.5 at a villa because like cash and daa are both 4.5 now I think Alex Moreno is probably 4.5 I didn't I didn't actually look and they side Matson who's going to play left back maybe yeah but he's five million so um okay but anyway like the 4.5s with these two teams like Robinson's not bad coner and like that that seems really good so um they don't offer much attacking potential obviously but um paed with possibly um you know the sort of less bonus Point potential for Defenders they aren't taking much maybe they're not great picks now I don't know it's um tough but may may at the same time with the shots on target thing is probably better going for more all out in attack so maybe the CHP defense could be a way to go as well so yeah yeah I like the rotation options anyway definitely and the shots on target for for the top teams it's going to pretty much be Wing backs who are going to be getting in positions like vardal maybe Trend but for the sort of the lower end teams it's going to be teams that are playing off set plays so someone like dunk maybe tki are going to be are going to pick up BPS for doing um yeah actions like that um do we want to talk about um well who who you like to talk about next uh yeah good question um should we go someone a bit more boring I guess like goalkeeper yeah okay goalkeepers because we talked I mean shows how boring we are that was like one of the first things I looked at and I messaged you about Kieran there's only four team team who have got a 4.5 and a 4.0 goalkeeper which you know it's not bad I think it was brenford and bford and wolves were the only two premier league teams and then it was all the pered sides have got full point and then of those I probably like brenford the best but thing is there's such like small brain theory about picking goalkeepers because you just can't predict their points like even though fen's got some crap away games against Liverpool and Man City like in week two and four and then Spurs in game week five you kind of think well you might get save points exactly yeah um yeah like I think wolves have got like horrible fixtures as well like they start but at the same time like you said save points possibly and you know you know they're definitely going to play you'll have the backup and the main starter so I been but yeah Arsenal way Chelsea at home like like you expec him next to no points for S there probably um so can you see yourself spending more than 4.5 on a goalkeeper or would that only happen do you think if you didn't go Harland annoying they priced orer at 5.5 I didn't even notice that yeah he's in my AO pick which that's so cheeky I think well Edison's rumored to um be leaving so that's I guess stupid they're not being stupid this season they're giving us some proper H that's annoying like it yeah as people say like it would have been gamebreaking if or if tager was the first choice starter at like five 4.5 in the city defense like I don't know if they can they've done this sort of like they that sort of thing has happened before with players sort of coming and or players leaving and coming into being first choice and just being absolute Bargains um and they've just not been able to change it because it's already it's already happened the prices and things so um yeah I think they've been smart this time around now what who have you got written down as like a keeper you like then is there any or have you just thought that that's your your budget for them well I thought Leno may be good obviously he's gone up to five million um which is obviously a shame um but like their fixtures apparently are like the second easiest according for the first four six fixtures according to like hub's um fixt ticket so um yeah Manny and I away Leicester home I switch away West Ham home Newcastle home they're not Forest away like that's not bad and and Leno was like the third highest scoring goalkeeper last season and he got 133 points so yeah that's also decent um yeah he got 134 saves across 38 game we which was the fifth best um 10 clean sheets which was fourth best which is good for Fulham of course uh 15 bonus in total which was third best of all Keepers and then 782 BPS uh which was first of all goalkeepers so um yeah maybe he gets a few a couple pens saves he won't get as many bonus but you know he get a goal 10 points yeah so and then he got 14th worst overall F him for XGC of 64.1 with 61 conceded so um yeah he he's just in a a fairly bad team and a kind of okay defense I guess um lost two key players though I'd say because Paul Paul has gone to Bayern isn't true true yeah was it aded aded beo who gone to Chelsea who was their Center back oh yes tosen yeah yeah yeah toen that's him yeah sorry out a bit well yeah he is out of Bio but yeah people call him to to make it easier so yeah they've both like they've both left so it' be yeah I mean I was looking at fulham's team because you right their fixtures I just they are they are good pretty much until game week 13 12 game weeks of decent fixtures the only difficult one I'd say on paper is Man City away game Villa at home is is not bad and man united away on the first game of the season neither team it's just basically that's going to be based on who's had a better preseason so I'd say that's that's quite close so yeah fulam fulam do look good to be honest I just think yeah it's five million so maybe maybe the if you wanted to go there then then Robinson yeah he he seemed like he was a good pick that you could have pretty much the whole season last year yeah um and he just sort of ticked away with points um so yeah maybe the 4.5s in the defense are better than than Leno this time round unfortunately um who do you like anyone at goalkeeper other than Fen not re not really I yeah when I sort of had a look at through all the teams earlier there was no one it really stood out to me like I'd would like to have Pickford maybe because of how good Everton were but I think we both thought at the end of last season he'd be up five and he is and I just don't like spending 5 million and even Onana had a great season last season and started five but I just don't like spending 5 million on a a goalkeeper because I just don't think the the upsides there um so don't have I don't have a favorite I'm just having a look at who did well Pickford who that's what happens if you can five find a 4.5 million gem more than likely they'll be they'll get to the top I mean two of the the top three started at 4.5 last year and even fleen I mean he was way down in the end but you know a 4.5 million goalkeeper there was that top teams goalkeepers mck guy who who started at the end of the season with Burnley and he scored like he got the most points out of um a few goal people I think it was for like six or something weeks um at the end of towards the end of the season with just like tons of save points and he's just been transferred to ipswitch so okay yeah a relegated or not relegated a promotion team um a 4.5 keeper like yeah they usually provide decent value in terms of saves so yeah he he could be okay interesting they've got a bit of a rough start as well Liverpool home and Man City away I think um yeah the Bren could be decent a 4.5 like um I would expect him to be the starting goalkeeper they're gonna be much less rotation I don't think the new the new manager is going to rotate Keepers all the time that seems stupid obviously he's the starting goalkeeper for Netherlands so would make sense for him to be the starter um the fixtures aren't too bad um they certainly get better from like Game 12 onwards but yeah I think um to start with like not bad for safe points possibly um and in a decent defense or decent well they weren't good at the start last season were they but um I expect them to be much more solid this time round what I've heard about that new manager is he's a bit of a expected goals conceded kind of Beast like what his teams have very good very good records also does it make you a bit sad that he's only 35 or is it 32 or something and yes managing a Premier League team good for him yeah is good for him but yeah so he's a bit of a defensive Beast so it will be you know another one to to monitor that yeah they could be good value and I like dunk from their team to be honest as well because I think the the BPS could could suit him and it's just a shame for me that with Brighton that their backup goal keeper is is 4.5 because I don't I hate like even at the end of last season I experienced it where I had Neto and just a fourpoint playing not goalkeeper just for the end of the season and and Netto was getting benched and I was missing out on that so I like to do it from the same team because then at least you know the the the same player is going to get in place or same team's going to get in place yeah I think um van Heck if he's still nailed on with um with dunk at 4.5 decent value um you know obviously not attacking but EST pinion looks to be injured on the he's five million U velman was usually the sort of uh right back I think it was yeah um he's 4.5 so yeah there there's decent value there too yeah I think they've done you know I think they've done quite a good a good job in making most defense of affordable at 4.5 and five I think I was expect expecting most players in the defensive line to be like at least point5 more expensive across the board yeah and not sure why they haven't done that whereas I think they have done that in the Midfield and forward line maybe it's just because the defense is like pretty much underperformed last year compared to Midfield ERS and Strikers yeah that's probably there um should we talk about a high performing Defender with in vardal oh yeah man city um yeah I didn't think either of us owned him towards the end of the season did we I owned him for the final game week only got one point maybe two points or something was it okay yeah he destroyed both of us at the end of the season basically we no idea what we didn't get on him I I banged on about him most weeks um good option and just never got him um but yeah he's obviously gone up to six million now um Canelo is actually in the game is who knows what's gonna happen there um I would not want to be picking V if Cano is actually staying obviously so um yeah let's hope Canelo leaves before the season starts and en vario can be a good option um yeah the fixtures are like like they're supposed to be like the 17th easiest hardest out of the uh the fixture difficulty rating to start with anyway um so maybe not great for for clean sheets and stuff but you know four goals two assists across last season like in game 30 to 38 where he picked up so many points like um his hardest opponent was actually only Arsenal um but then he did get nine points there um and then he there was also Spurs away which he also get six points as well so it wasn't surprising that he did well so he should have picked it up there but yeah game 28 to 38 no Defender scored more points either got 79 points in that in 10 weeks which is really good seventh highest scoring Defender overall with 123 and I think he he missed probably roughly like 10 games is from little bit of injury a little bit of rotation so um yeah I think um I think he surely nailed down that spot from the end of last season um yeah his his assist stats were sort of like kind of low but his attacking stats were were really good like 2.11 XG from this is um 30 to 38 which was first of all Defenders um his shots was 14 which was fourth uh 3.1 expected goals involvement which was second of all Defenders and then four big chances which was second as well so like he was um yeah the one to go for pretty much to be honest um so I I think he's surely gonna be a good option um I think many teams will will go there um and I most likely will but we'll see yeah I think um the the strong end of the season and you know the reasonable pricing is going to make him a a favorite as well and man city started well last season we every week I remember at the start of last season we were like Walker's doing well next week Walker's still doing well and he was only like baselining on six but City had a strong defensive start of the season last year and neither of us ever ever went there and I feel like they do that we tried to yeah so you know we've been we were burned last season but perhaps you know he makes more sense but it's I'd forgotten to be honest about canel coming back so yeah I think that's quite a an yeah something to monitor for sure if he's actually going to stay or not and um yeah what that means for's position in the in the team really um all right is there anyone else you really want to chitchat about or do you want me to uh do you want to talk about the the team I put together oh let's do the team let's go for it okay let's I mean there is loads of other people but let's just um there's loads of time to go for everyone to be honest so this is what I put together oh I'm going to keep keep that there can you see all right here we go I need to make this a bit a bit bigger there they've changed the pitch design so everything's much much smaller yeah see people talking that they don't like it but it looks perfectly nice here we go there that's the the best I can do at short notice but I think it's all right so in goal like are we talking about flecking and big Vlad the um brenford pair I I hate how they changed it a couple years ago and like even if you I used to put my players in like in price order but they just jumbl them up so CBA and Garda got in at six million the coner burn rotation which he'd already talked about I'd fancied face F at four million looks like a nailed on starter then in Midfield I'd gone for my H my heavy boys sacka Palmer Salah e Talisman some randomer sang 4.5 million we discussed we didn't know any 4 million 4.5 million starters and then up front Big Boy San Isaac San and munes yeah San's not got bad fixtures and he's on pens and and munes has got good fixtures as well so you know that's what I put together earlier what slanky fixtures this is going to be mive now that I've enlarged everything Forest Newcastle Everton Chelsea Liverpool Southampton Leicester that's not bad for the first seven games game weeks anyway so that's that's what I I put put together it seemed like quite a you know quite a nice non- harand team with quite a few penalty takers in it and yeah that's right yeah to be I had even looked at his pictures they they did look they do look fine to be honest he was such a troll last season 7.5 million I thought that would seem like okay considering what a good season he had last season yeah Moon I'm just like I like his price um and I like his fixtures but like he sort of stopped scoring didn't he like he had that run um but then he stopped he just stopped doing much of of anything towards the end of the season so I'm just worried that that might happen again um and you just have him in his team every week for the good pictures and he's just not doing anything um yeah but I guess he's just got a good price isn't he like there's there's Visser six million he's okay L 6 million like yeah there's not much was actually good actually good for like a few weeks though wasn't he for sure yeah he was nine goals and two assists in 1, so you'd play 3,000 so double that 18 and four 180 points if you get 180 points off a six million player because the think I think from lower from what I looked at earlier you're right about the forward line it is a bit rinsed but like full you would expect to be top half of the bottom half of the table so mid-table and it doesn't look like he's got any competition for the central or Center forward role where you don't think himz will maybe I don't know not was the first choice for four he got injured so but then mun is like was bossing it I don't know anyway it's still like a month to go and see in preseason I see Pedro's interesting again um because he's 5.5 course yeah I don't know if Ferguson I think he injured welbeck's obviously still there so yeah yeah I I think he'll definitely play um just I guess we'll see what happens with the the um the manager see if he's still on penalties he probably he probably should be um yeah I think he'll definitely be a good option he'll definitely be a good he'll probably be the enabler for teams that go for harand especially in the um the forward line yeah I can't haven't even done like a a harand draft just to compare but yeah maybe the closer we'll we'll get we'll do that right is any more we want to add on today do you think that's all right no I think I think we covered it yeah there's just yeah plenty of preseason to go um we'll keep an eye on on what most teams are doing and I'm sure we'll be upgrading our teams as soon as Salah scores against uh some terrible team somewhere and yeah yeah harand scores like five goals against um l or something again God yeah panicking exactly yeah yeah so we're we're what we we're four weeks out aren't we so perhaps we'll do another a show in a couple weeks time once we've got uh some preseason information under our belts and then maybe one in the week leading up so uh yeah we'll keep you posted yeah cool all right thanks everyone for joining us",8926

Welcome to our end of season review I'm Chris and Kieran is here too how are you doing today yeah all good all well how are you yeah I'm um yeah I suppose I'm happy in some ways the game game week is over the season is over cuz we can have a little bit of a a reset now feel the same way yeah looking forward to the euros and stuff like that and just kind of um yeah the the season sort of peted out pretty badly for me so I'm yeah I'm just kind of looking forward to just what's coming up over the summer and then quickly straight back into FB as say isn't it yeah I know we were just talking quickly about about it then that the fact that we' got the FA Cup UCL Euros which I'm absolutely going to do the fantasy for but like you I'm definitely not going to be taking as seriously and then yeah it won't be long before we jump back in and got another season to get stuck into so no I can't wait at all let's let's start off I suppose by doing a recap but just on this show tonight we're just going to talk about some of the surprises of the Season uh we're going to look at sort of let Downs who we earmarked and perhaps like some learnings from that and uh also just perhaps look ahead to see who could be featuring our teams for the start of next season obviously price dependent so let's talk about how we finished keik do you want to talk about Mr Wilson two years running yeah um so I think how said he was supposed to be fit and or should be fit and ready to like after like illness I think it was supposed to just be illness the week before that's why he didn't turn up in the double um so yeah I yeah there was loads of rumors of him being the one that possibly will start and Isaac was gonna be bench so I I yeah I fell for the fake team news of Isaac benching so I sold Isaac um which is um really bloody dumb but I got gapco in and and I was talking about Mata last week as mateta was pretty much my option until I ended up with um you know selling EAC for gapco so um yeah that didn't go to plann um and then yeah Gusto didn't sh up I was really surprised by really thought he would play um obviously he played got a yellow card classic um yeah the only good things really was the foden son porro like is just um you know poor end of the season is all it is yeah so I think so frustrating on um the Wilson and Isaac fromont like we talked about it like obviously just ahead of the deadline because it's so stressful especially when it's I just got almost next season I want to like shut my phone off but you kind of feel like you you don't get the advantage but everyone's just talking about team team leaks and team news you don't know who to believe there all this R like strong rumor as well that Isaac was was getting benched he wasn't even the squad but I feel like there's only a few proper like leakers you can you can trust so yeah next season I'm going to try and switch off from that a little bit more because I don't think it it helped like decision making yeah I just I'm just not GNA like listen to anything other than from you know the ones that are actually just need to stop it and just yeah I hate because like like you as well like we were talking about it right up to the deadline jamama just in the chat has said as well he bought in gakpo for Isaac as well and I kind of feel like I don't not many people would have would have done that based on like Isaac's form they would have perhaps got rid of another Striker for gako for that game so yeah I kind of feel like it's got to somehow filter that out I I was we were talking about the start of the Season maybe a bit later but I was burned right at the start of the Season as you were with uh Gabrielle and CBA and it just feels like start of game weeks can make a a big difference so yeah sucked um anyway my my and gameweek 30 it went so much better sadly for you I know well I'd had Mata since gameweek 34 and he's just been a beast for me at the end of the season and looks good for for next season as well and obviously Isaac who i' benched for Garo thinking he was going to hit bench has just come on automatically for sacka I finally got some points off finally got some points off Trent which I was pleased about Henderson kept a clean sheet as well and obviously Aston Villa were half asleep so yeah I had I good rank rise and finished on 77k in the end so I was I was pleased with that yeah nice um yeah just good end of the season for you um you had lots of weeks where it sort of um seemed to all sort of go your way and um and then you had a few backwards ones but def yeah I think I didn't expect like after I had a little quick look so the best overall rank I had at the season which unsurprisingly at the end of gameweek 34 probably like you were as well when I was up to 43k and then by game week or start of gameweek 38 to be outside the top 100K because we just got ruined in gameweek 37 it was really just the differentials of mateta and Trent Henderson that pulled it back for me really so now they' got had a bit of a last day boost I just want to talk a little bit about the start of next season and like rank progression a little bit I don't know if you've looked at this but I thought it was interesting to say at the top of the show because obviously found out who the winner was who won by like 40 50 odd points and I think something that's happened definitely for me the last two seasons and and I don't know about you you perhaps to tell me but like I had a slow start again this season so season before this one just gone I was outside the top two million before the World Cup started in December this season I didn't break into the top million until gameweek 12 or get into the top 100,000 until gameweek 30 so if I can compare that with like the winner this season he was he was in the top million in game week 2 so like 10 game weeks before and he was in the top 1,000k by game week four so 26 game weeks before and then he just managed his team throughout and I looked through like maybe the top top 10 or so roughly just see and having a a start like a good start was so crucial they've all like got to within top 100,000 top 50,000 easily by the first 10 game weeks it's just like a com did he um did he use all his chips early or no he didn't he just he used his wild card game week eight which was pretty much like the norm and he just had a a balanced team and I think I said throughout the season to you and on here like I wasn't ever keen on the double UPS in the same line so double defense double mids and but at the start of the Season like you I had double Arsenal mids and double United mids so four of our Midfield slots were taken up by the same team if you look at his team he had such a good balance in hindsight so he had Salah saaka Bruno membo EZ with Pedro and Harland up up top all penalty takers he had no double UPS in defense either even when he played his wild card in in game week eight he had no doubles in attack or Defender and he swapped in midfielders Bowen muo Sun Salah Netto Harland and Watkins so again I think that's like six or seven of eight uh penalty takers so my just like brief analysis from that was I think definitely at the start of this season coming and need to be more more balanced for sure I don't know if youve the same way about that but I think this seon just passed it was so easy to look at the fixtures and play teams without knowing what their own form like because United did not live up to their preseason hype yeah I'm one for doubles and treles quite often um and sometimes it works sometimes most of the time I guess it doesn't um it's hard to pick which ones the best sometimes um especially like with Gabrielle and stuff this season um true so yeah I mean doubles can work at times but then you know like in the the double game weeks when we saw mateta and E and Alis and all Smash It In Like A a double game I triple attack for them so yeah like it can work but it just need it often it doesn't especially just the single game weeks across a while like it doesn't seem to pan out very well no I think yeah definitely Choice moments to have it yeah and just on my my end of the season like I was just going to say that my my best overall rank was also in gaming 34 was 6 3K so that's you know compared to like my last four five seasons that's like this season is my worst rank um out of the last five seasons my lowest before that was 48k and the highest was 15K so I was finishing inside the top 50k for five seasons in a row um and obviously this season has been the worst um since but um yeah like the best my best run of greens all season was game 19 to 22 was only four Greens in a row then they had four red arrows to end the season from game we 35 to 38 so usually that's the sort of time where you need to um or should be going up the ranks if you're playing it properly of just where you you know to finally have that final push and and I just got four Reds in a row and it was just atrocious ense of the season um I just yeah like you said before those gaming 35 wild card differentials of um you know garol and Gordon and Jackson and all those stuff just ended up ruining me like yeah I think that that's what it like was for me as well I didn't I didn't think that gameweek 35 wild card like different well players in Jackson and gardial were going to be so strong but they but they were like yeah Jackson was good in like well three game weeks in a row and obviously we know what vardal did and I think yeah just those two players were probably enough outside the template at that point to yeah to cause just yeah big rank swings basically so yeah it's definitely something to look out for but I don't think we're going to be getting that as much next season are we with the no uh replays in the FA Cup so it will be interesting how next season pans out with the lack of double game leags were you um like ever very like stubborn on players because I didn't I didn't own vardal all season I didn't own Gordon all season um there's quite a few players I didn't sort of I just didn't get on like I didn't own Bowen All Season all those sort of things like E I didn't own All Season you know well about you it's so funny because that was definitely one of the things to talk about in my definitely a surprise of the season was foden so the fact that I think he he went up another level this season I think he's obviously partly the reason that city won the title all the goals he scored and obviously his best ever return 19 goals eight assists but I only had him from game weeks 35 to 38 and that was five crazy it is mad isn't it like you think of player who finished second highest in the midfielder rankings I only had for I mean it was effectively five games because of the the double in there but one of them he didn't start when I got him a 35 he didn't even play against Forest cuz he was injured and he had a blank against Spurs so I got I think I got like four returns off him so when you think he got uh what was it when he got 27 returns all season and I got four of them that's crazy that's crazy and he got two hat tricks didn't he I didn't get either of those yeah so yeah I feel like I missed and you you're right about Gordon I feel like he's another one who just had like an amazing season I don't should we talk about surprises actually ones I got well I'll just I'll just pick up more on on Gordon because I think he's probably probably the biggest surprise of the season after Palmer because you know he's playing for a team that traditionally have been outside of the top four admittedly they got there last season he moved in January of 2023 so like he had half a season to start and he's just absolutely smashed his previous number so in 2122 he had 2,200 minutes he had seven returns last season was a bit of a mix season cuz he moved played one and a half thousand minutes across the season he had four returns this season he had 27 returns in 2,800 minutes so basically he he got like four times more than his best ever return he got 11 goals and 16 assists I mean that's just such a crazy uplift like you would not think from a player who's got 11 returns in two seasons to then get 27 returns in one like where how has that happened and I don't know if you saw like his he had did like an interview with the overlap about how like focused he is and or how he prepares for games and how he wanted to move from Everton to like further his career and I think he's definitely done that this season he's just been a revelation really for a player I didn't think was going to be anywhere near that level do you think he's going to get any minutes in the Euros would he be anywhere near the first I kind of hope hope so because I kind of now that rashford's not going he's definitely had admittedly he hasn't got like the big game experience that greish has in perhaps playing champions league and he did play Champions League this year didn't he I suppose he did I suppose he did but when you say and DM and that's true that's true but when you say G Gish has like won the Champions League and he's played in England or played for England major tournaments then maybe that's got the edge on him but if you're basing it on form I'd say like he's probably our best left-sided front player if you'd say that's not foden's main position so yeah I think he's just been amazing this season and did so you didn't own him at all no not not even once not once that's crazy isn't it I I got him just before a really tricky run and he ended up doing really well I think I bought him I bought him when he went from game week I think I've got him in game week 10 and he played Wolves Away in his first game and he got two but then he got 2 7 2 13 10 and that was like I think his almost his biggest run of of double digits Halls so yeah he's just been really good and what kind of price do you think next season so he started at 55 he ended at 64 you think seven yeah I think well what what did Barnes get as like most expensive at leester he was probably around seven wasn't he when he was do at Leicester so I yeah I would guess round seven that's not bad that would make sense um foden started at 75 this year for context yeah he might even get up to a premium this next season he might be like 10.5 or 10 with yeah with kdb might be along those that sort of price even Palmer might get towards like we got a lack of premiums in the game there's Salah Salah Holland and then the next is is KD B so I know I really think they could do with I mean this we're getting into price discussion already now but I I would love it if you're right if sacka foden Palmer and sun and even Salah were all brought down into the range of like 10 to 12 cuz has had his like his his Worst season in years and he's had four players perform better than him like I don't think there's been a season when he's been that far down the ranking so said do you want to talk about Palmer as a surprise of the the season because sure um so yeah I mean obviously like he got the most returns or joint most returns of the season um 35 goal contributions of Harland um yeah he started at 5 million as a bench backup at city um you know ended up in the first team at Chelsea on 6.3 with 13 price Rises and and over 50% ownership in the game which is um yeah I don't think anyone saw that coming when he was still at city for sure so um yeah our friend friend George got him at 4.9 million which is um yeah and then kept him across the whole season and just yeah amazing um so he's he started his first game in game seven which is crazy and then he still ended up as the highest point scorer with 244 points um yeah that is quite a low sort of top scorer for like I think Salah made it up to like 270 is before and like 244 seems fairly lowish but I guess that just the season was like it was a little bit more spread out I guess in terms of Point scorers um yeah his average across the season like across all games was 7.8 points per game um so amazing um yeah he had monster holes in there of 26 20 and 18 and then he was consistent across most weeks as well getting at least one return so um yeah like I said he made up um yeah like by game s Salah was on 43 points harem was on 51 and he made up all those points and more to obviously be the winner so yeah that's crazy amazing um yeah like I said 35 goal contributions 22 goals 13 assists um yeah next season probably going to be up around 9 mil I would guess I think so is he gonna get that big of a price rise I hope so just or are they going to be cautious just because of where he started last season I don't know I you're right I could see them going either way I would I would hope that they would price him as a as a premium yeah like rash rashford had a so like sun price this year nine rashford so last season I mean um the season before last rashford had his best ever season and scored 20 three because I was looking it up earlier for some just notes on what a let down he's been so 203 so Palmer scored 230 rashford started this season at nine okay so yeah he could be up like 10ish 9.5 i' I'd be happy with that I'd be happy there's obviously a big question mark about with Chelsea now because poch has gone and who are their managers and all this like stuff you read on Twitter about how we want a progressive young manager who wants to keep the possession of the ball and win football matches well yeah no [ __ ] wasn't that Potter yeah oh I know so yeah be interest the talk is is going to be desery but like they bought another like upcoming Progressive young manager from Brighton and he saw how that went so um yeah I don't know strange um embarrassing to be honest um yeah so another surprise of the season um yeah went a little bit under the radar towards the end was um was Alvarez like I was very happy with him to start the season he started every single game of the season up until kdb's return from injury um he was obviously a cut price way into the city attack um at 6.56 I'm not actually sure what he started at because I don't think you can go back and check uh you can let me just have a quick look for you he was how you find that out okay you got going their history and it's right down at the bottom somewhere right um so yeah he was um offered the sort of double up opportunities in attack with harand which I which I did get on to eventually I think it was like round gamic four I think I got onto him um I think I sold yeah J Pedro because I was I was a big J Pedro believer at the start of the season and and that and up very bad um but yeah got on Alvarez um and yeah he was really good so he was the sixth highest scoring forward at 158 points um yeah did see his minutes start to get significantly reduced towards the end of the season which is obviously a bit of a shame because he was such a he he really stepped up in sort of the absence of KD B even when Harlem was injured he stepped up in attack and he was good for them all season he always provided goals like came off the bench in the Champions League and scored goals and like it's it's a real shame that he just lost his place just because kdb was back like um yeah he should have been well maybe there's rumors of kdb going or being sold this season possibly going to the MLS so if that happens like Alvarez back straight back in right so um interesting um yeah he had 14 and 13 Point holes in in his season with 22 goal involvements 11 goals 11 assists um I'm expecting his price to go up by around to around 77.5 I guessed um so it's a decent 1 million-ish price like 8 million I think would be a little bit steep if he's not going to be a first teamer um but that that could be still be good value if if kdb or harand kdb goes or Holland end up Miss Missing time like he's still good value at that price um yeah he finished first for forwards for key passes at 67 first for ex expected assists as well at 6.28 across the season so um yeah he was a great asset um shame like I said what happened to him at the end and big surprise to me and just glad he got his chance and hopefully we can see more of him again next season yeah I I agree I feel like he's been such a good um asset for City this season and we were definitely again boning him at the start of the season because he was playing week and week out and doing really well and neither of us had him and he was a good price like the first I'm just having a look at like his returns like if I was just going through the games he had one then one then three then and two like see he was getting like multiples of returns and you not owning him it was it was bad he actually had more minutes I was just having a look then Harland across the season um yeah he's just he just didn't haul but yeah 11 goals and 11 assists he he was good you're right if there's any changes to De bruy he he just like filled in so well so I could absolutely expect that happening again next season really and and if harland's out of the piture he was taking pens I think I captained him for one game as well and and he did well I think that was after de bruyne got brace I think he got two braces yeah it must it was a home game it was against Burnley they won 3-1 yeah that was it yeah no he he did well for me when I was that where harand didn't play I think he got a penalty in it that's right yeah I think harand didn't play de it was like de Bru second game back at home and I think you'd got de bruy didn't you and I hadn't I just got um Alvarez Captain but yeah I agree he was a great great pick this season nice um I sort of talked a little bit about F foden being a surprise um so perhaps we on to the letdowns it mention mentioned rashford a little bit earlier and just so so poor like we both had him in our gameweek one teams he seemed pretty well priced maybe if you'd agree at 9 million because he like he'd had such a good season last time and I think a lot of our thought process was and it's definitely something to be mindful of this year is like how easily can players replicate that that form but yeah the fixtures are really good for United at the start as well they were really good and they'd had like a good end to the season rashford had been playing well he'd had his best ever season like 19 17 goals seven assists yeah he just seem Rosy and even though United had lost the the Cup Final the seemed like the momentum was good and yeah they he just had such a a sluggish start to the season I think he had three goal involvements in maybe it's like the first 12 game weeks and I don't think I had him that long but yeah he's he's just been really really poor so he actually played 2,200 minutes over the course of The Campaign which is way higher than I thought because he definitely didn't see him started 26 League games he only scored a total of 108 points so just about half what he did last season his points per match was 3.2 so that was m in terms of United players that was matched by Anana beted by Bruno garnacho and hyand but then if you look around the league that's such a poor metric so he was roughly 50th best of all mids for points per match over the course of the season so yeah the drop off from what we experienced the season before was huge and only 10 Returns all season seven seven goals three assists yeah 2,200 minutes is roughly like like a two thirds of the season is that right yeah because I think 3,400 is is roughly the max yeah so yeah to do to do that in that amount of minutes is um is really crap isn't it like that's so poor like you like Gordon like you said earlier 2.8k minute so only 600 more minutes but managed 11 goals 16 assists like and for cheaper and just probably in like well I was gonna say a worst team worst team historically I suppose but um yeah rashford just um yeah he's he's I've always been not a huge fan of him and yeah he just seems to keep proving me right um like like like he's not in the EUR Squad it's like he's not he's got no form like he probably should be I feel like he should be I think he's a good explosive sub I think he's probably more explosive sub as what someone like Gordon would be to be honest um so yeah a shame for him but like maybe he uses that as sort of like um motivation for next season I guess we'll see but um yeah such a shame yeah it is um yeah let's hope he's back there's a lot of rumors about him maybe moving as well I mean there's rumors about literally everyone at this stage of the season because clicks but yeah no I can't see either uh should I go for one yeah so big letd down this season um Gabby Jesus at um 8 million he started at um you know he was in most of our teams to start last season and he he did really well um yeah I I obviously had high hopes for him this season um I thought he could be a consistent pick in our teams um but yeah injuries seemed to be plaguing his career now seemed to fall out a favorite at the end of the season when he was fit like he he's he wasn't getting picked havitz havitz made that spot his own as sort of the false nine and and Jesus just I when he was playing like towards the end of the season he was in sort of um left mid area where Martin usually was so um yeah not great for him like yeah after moving from City he got a decent return like last year in 11 goals seven assists um but this season he got four goals seven assists um really bad um will Arsenal try and sell him this summer maybe um they I I don't see why they shouldn't to be honest like maybe they look for a proper number nine and then sell Jesus I think that's probably a good way to make some money like he's he's not really done much and he's probably not going to do much anymore because they've got habits that can just play there now so um yeah I think um he missed 12 matches entirely the season he got less minut less than 15 minutes in five games as well of so that's like 17 matches he basically played nothing um so yeah just a big disappointment like for such a big name um sort of should be the sign Striker for Arsenal who who Arsenal had such a great season like um yeah the injuries and the the minut and havs taking his spot is just um just a big shame for such a a big name player you know I think hits has done done really well by like comparison like I think J Jesus's like criticism against him for years as he's been like he's not a good finisher but he works really hard kind of feel like havitz is is working really hard for the team and he's he's putting away the chances and he seems more involved from an FPL point of view so for us as like I kind of think havit will probably be classified next year as a forward which yeah probably which you know would be an interest interesting could be good it could be good yeah but um I imagine his price will go up as well I think he finished at 7.4 but yeah I agree gz had been a let down this season I kind of thought he'd be yeah number one and H's been playing back up for that but I think because of his injuries he's just been easy to yeah dislodge like I'm just having look at the the overall points like he finished less than adabo slightly more than like andw the Burnley Ford I've not pronounced that name right but Andy andone yeah so you know I appreciate he's had injuries but he's wouldn't surprise me if Arsenal bu another Striker this year and and phas out even though he's only recently arrived yeah they need that number nine to really push on I guess to just finish those like back post sort of chances and um yeah if they could get a striker that's getting 20 goals then then they should be able to step up to that next spot but like who the hell they would they would buy I I have no idea I agree no maybe it'll be yeah there's been obviously again like I say talk of Isaac talk of Tony but yeah be interesting to see if they sign a new Striker but even still I don't think they're going to change or have HTS for the foreal because he's had such a good end to the season and kind of that links a little bit onto a player who I thought was a bit of let down as well which again is funny because Arsenal had such a good season last season and I think two of their important players have just not really featured much so Martinelli for me who was you know kind of a gameweek one template type player he had huge hype after last season he' got 15 goals nine assists and he scored 198 points so only six fewer than rashford and only three fewer than sacka and he came in at 8 million and we all were thinking well that's great if he can replicate that form he ended at 7.4 million so he lost6 in value and I don't know I was S I was just surprised that he fell away to the level he did he still played a lot of minutes so 2,000 minutes um but he only had six goals five assists so less than half of the returns he got last season and I think that was more telling like we talked about trossard towards the end of the season and he was returning well from the left foot Arsenal but he basically kept Marell at the team he lost his place was injured in gameweek 28 and didn't start another game until the final day of the season so yeah it was he's another player who definitely shouldn't forget about but it's funny how a season will change a player's form like I get like had such high hopes for him to like kick on but he finished behind trossard behind rice behind havit behind odard behind sacka in Arsenal's Midfield rankings when the season before he'd been like their second highest performing player so yeah I think I think there's definitely something to learn but I'm not sure what about like being mindful of players repeating their form season on season I think salah's been a bit of a freak at that and I think Harland has too so it will be Saka too Saka has been pretty good on yeah Saka has been Saka has been good Saka has been good yeah he's got he's gradually just got better and better actually 114 179 202 226 so yeah I think you probably back him but it just be you know I feel like this has definitely been a breakout season from an FPL point of view for foden like he nearly got 100 points more than his previous best and obviously Palmer is definitely an unknown at the start of this season um from an FPL point of view and he's absolutely smashed it so it's definitely worth thinking or looking at Players like Martinelli have done well in the past but then the form has fallen off a cliff the next season yeah interesting um maybe just be wary of those players get a couple of those sort of fringy players um when we're picking next season I suppose yeah interesting um so yeah for me um Tony um 7.5 million uh banned until game at 20 for gambling obviously um came back straight into the team from game 21 and played uh basically full 90 minutes straight away until he got injured in in game 32 um yeah he started on fire with eight 10 two six and six the first five weeks he came back um but from 25 onwards this this you got one two two 2 one 5 2 1 0 0 22 one4 so we got two assists in 14 weeks um that's crazy and he's made the Euro Squad yeah I suppose there's there's not many other Strikers to pick from for English I suppose Morris get Morris in there sure season yeah sank is probably a little bit unlucky compared to yeah sank should be in there ahead of Tony for sure actually um but yeah he basically just ended the season in drastically bad form and I've got here on my notes just like he may as well still been banned because viser and Ando were doing just just as good a job that they were at the start of season without Tony being there like he just he was trying to sort of put himself in the shop window for to get a big move for a bigger club and you know this end of season form was just drastically bad um and yeah he hasn't put his sort of Self in the window for anybody I wouldn't assume I think there's rumors that Spurs are looking at him which I think is kind of interesting but I think that's probably a let down for where he was trying to go for someone like Arsenal or man united so um yeah man the man united thing is probably never gonna happen because they got oand now but um yeah Tony like we'll see what happens but yeah just really really bad end of the season um big let down in terms of not being available for most of the Season as well like um yeah in 23 24 he had four four goals three assists and he did have something like 15 odd weeks that he could oh no it was like it was 14 weeks play yeah he he had 19 weeks to play or 18 weeks sorry that he could have got you know a away of four goals and three assists in n in 18 weeks is um really bad um and obviously in 2223 he had he came off 20 goals four assists and then the season for at 12 goals five assists so yeah coming off where he looked like he was like straight back on it when he came back from it um yeah the the drop off was insane um yeah so he's probably gonna go down in price and unless he gets a big move to somewhere um a seven million Tony might be quite good for next season yeah he was he started at eight didn't he I'm just having a look at what he was that right okay yeah he started at eight he went to 77 and in previous season he start looks like he started at 7even and finished at 7.1 that was the season he did really well I don't know why he finished at seven oh maybe because of the ban came into effect at the end of the season yeah I'm not sure I don't know price at end of season 71 price at start seven don't know but he got 20 season before he was he was a good pick and he was someone you could reliably pick in your team and and hope for some points that are sort of a cheaper you know you always seem to want that one sort of Striker from a sort of lower end team that gets good points and he he was that and just obviously wasn't this year if he if he gets down because of his bad end the season if he does stay at brenford and he's it's funny though how things changed on a different season though because I think if he stays at brenford and if he goes down to 7.5 he's going to look like a a good pick for gameweek one just because we know he's a penalty Taker and maybe that he knew he came back brenford were pretty safe from getting relegated they didn't really have anything too much to play for maybe he was playing for his England place I guess but yeah they i' definitely describe him as very underwhelming for the end of the season yeah um all right so play players for next season or have you got any more for letdowns or trolls or um yeah I just wanted to mention unuku um oh yeah yeah obviously was injured most of the whole year like I've been a big fan of his in Champions League and stuff like that and I was super excited from him this season um we were talking about him most of the preseason was just someone that yeah we should be picking because he's just so good um just yeah a big shame um but yeah he's a fantastic player I hope we can see him injury free next next year and playing week in week out with Palmer I think will be super exciting for Chelsea um obviously we need to see what the the um coach or manager sort of situation is like but um yeah he got three goals in 400 minutes this season not too bad I suppose after being super injured so yeah getting three goals and has been okay um but yeah I'm just excited to see him next season with um and hopefully just come back from injury and be and be good to go because yeah in his other seasons in Bundesliga and stuff like that he's been such a a great player so um yeah hopefully I imagine he's probably not going to get into the French Squad because of his injuries so that's a shame as well but um means he'll be fresh indeed yeah looking forward to him next season yeah um who oh yeah so we're mve on to should we talk about maybe players for next season does that sound all right very early looking this is so speculative because you you know it's going to be very different I'm sure by the time we um get get near there but um obviously probably starting with Palace is a a good place because they had such a glow up didn't they the glass glass glow up and I think even despite their glow up I think e remained pretty under the radar you know and it's easy to talk about his name because he scored well the the final game we of the season but he was actually doing really well for a long period leading up to that so from gameweek 27 he came back from injury played every game bar one uh until the end of the season he was averaging seven points per 90 minutes which is the fifth be uh fifth best of all midfielders in the game and he he got some good good scores in that time uh he got two three double digit Halles and he got an eight and a five in there I think he got about eight returns during that time so he was a good pick and his price hasn't deviated too much this season either I think he started at six and and ended at six as well so I you know oh no started sorry better than that it started at 6.5 and he went down to six so I kind of think next season he could probably only go back up to 6.5 and you know penalty taker in a definitely more attacking minded team I definitely think there's good reason to have him nestled into a game we one team obviously fixture dependent I think a lot of put off last season because they had Arsenal game week two start the season but shefford United away brenford away they well they still had Roy oin as manager at that point just thans yeah yeah yeah but you know he's SC two he's got two returns in the first seven games last season but then to end on sort of like eight and and 12 towards the end I think it's definitely a noticeable change and hope he has a good Euros as well really yeah I think he he was like a close to Fringe template player at the start of the season and some people went for him some people just like avoided and um yeah he did let down at the start of the season but like he obviously came good in the end um yeah I think it's um I think it's interesting for Palace like if they keep them all they then they should maybe they're good enough to try and get into like Europa conference like like eighth I I think that's possible for them if they keep those good those good players and without GL glas has been making them sort of obviously way better just in general then they've got the manager and the sort of team at the moment that um I think they can get into Europe but at the same time you know Al and E these bigger teams are definitely going to be looking at them I think mat Mata will probably stay but it's Alis and E like yeah teams are going to be looking big time at those two um so I guess I guess we'll see what happens but I would be surprised if they all stay I I really would think yeah they only finished three points off like best of the rest cuz West Ham or let's I say when I say best of the rest is outside the the top eight they were like 10th was that they were 10th yeah and you know man united finished eth Newcastle seventh Chelsea sixth so they were only what was it 11 points behind United by the end of the season if they'd had yeah him in place all season then yeah who knows but their form definitely ticked up a lot yeah they they smashed United in there they beat Liverpool they um they beat Newcastle at the end of like so they they're not afraid to mix it with the big boys clearly as as well so they only had they only had four wins from game week one to to gameweek 19 so yeah there that's Ro H yeah and then they had six out of six out of their last seven games were all wins so I mean they got majority of their games wins at the end and yeah glas made a big difference so yeah I think he's good and yeah obviously do you want to talk about mateta as well because yeah I think if he if they keep the other two yeah I think he started a five million is that right I don't know if you can ever look um yeah so he was the fifth highest scoring forward in the end on 165 points um yeah from game 23 to 38 he was incredible value so he got 625 6 289 2 5 2 16 13 2 6 9 20 so you got four blanks in 23 to 38 and you got 15 goals through assists in that time so yeah um he was like sort of Cheaper chips uh free hit and bench boost hero in game a double game 34 or 29 Points um any anyone who captained him were absolutely laughing um yeah and obviously you you add him for the last game week got 20 points is that right hatrick and assist so he's crazy of course so um yeah game 30 to 38 Palace scored 24 goals which is the fourth best of all teams with 563 points from their assets which was fourth best so yeah all of them at the time was smashing um yeah like I said before if Palace keep as Alis I think Mata will be a great option next season Edward doesn't seem to be or clearly is not the the number one anymore like mateta is clearly nailed down his place of how he's been performing he was still being taking off around the 70 minutes like pretty much every game which is a shame um if he if he'd stayed on he could be getting more points but um yeah 6.5 price point next season that seems probably about right if he keeps uh if he stays in that sort of um uh at Palace obviously um so I think that seems like a good price point for him next season it's it'll definitely be an option yeah it's interesting how much better he's been and like again whether that's like a bit like we talked about with rashford like how sustainable that is I just had a look at his previous he wasn't good last season was he he had two goals in 29 appearances last season and five goals in 22 year before yeah like the start of the Season he was pretty bad too so just I don't know just a massive run of form with the two player like at least they wasn't available e missed quite a bit as well like So that obviously affected it yeah and maybe it's the teams they played but sometimes it is hard to get engaging at end of the season but you know there's no denying they played well and scor goals they beat some you know some fairly decent teams in that run in appreciate on the final day Villa probably didn't have very much to play for and but you know they spanked United they beat Wolves Away quite comfortably they beat Newcastle at home quite comfortably obviously smash West Ham you know scored two goals at home against City so they they did pretty well oh they won away against Liverpool so yeah think could be serious people talking about Trent at six million I can't really see that cheap can you I know we haven't really talked about I haven't got any like notes on slot really but suppose we'll cover it when we do preseason but he it's a shame he's been so expensive this season because yeah with Arsenal being so Arsenal being so good and him being so expensive he's been fairly no go or no need to go what do you think he's could could end up so I'm just having a look at his price so he ended at 84 started at 85 well he's definitely not going to be anywhere near Eight um I don't think anywhere near six seven seven seems fair I think seven seven 7.5 I don't yeah six million is no no chance that seems like such a huge drop doesn't it so his last Eight's too much 8.5 is definitely too much so yeah 7.5 is probably probably right sorry my bad he started this season at eight okay start the season seven seven then yeah the previous three seasons he was 7.5 and then before that he was seven but it's to be fair it's his wor it's his Worst season for yeah for two or three seasons it's unknown of what slot's goingon to be like if he's assume he will be first choice of course but um we we don't know how sort of a defensive manager he is and well I'm sure there is research out there um but I have not done that um but yeah just I guess we'll see um he could be someone that could be in everyone's team again if he's priced slowly yeah um who else have I got written down I mean maybe some obvious ones on the city defense so perhaps I won't spend too much on this before talking about my my final one but it's interesting how at the start of the Season you and I both wanted stones and I was thinking about how everyone ended up pretty much on a city Defender as a temp play but for most of the Season generally they were all pretty irrelevant but when you look at the overall like standings Walker and cardol ended up getting up there despite the fact they've been really ped defensively by their standards before that so in the last four seasons working from most recent just finished now they had 11 clean sheets season before 11 season before 20 season before 19 so you know they can do good defensive Seasons but they just haven't been and I don't know what's changed I know we the whole league has like definitely seen more goals and defenses are either worse or attacks are better but you know Walker and um started at five ended at 5.5 I think vardal is going to end at like 5.2 and I think he started at five so you know if they're if they're kind with the pricing I maybe get maybe both of those will come in at 5.5 and I think because Arsenal def Defenders are going to have such a hike maybe it's worth persevering with a city Defender next season because you know Walker played most of the minutes this season and got five attacking returns was his most for like four or five seasons I mean someone like AK played a lot of the minutes as well um yeah even aan played a lot of the minutes it seemed to be Diaz that was the one getting rotated mostly um but but we've seen that before like Diaz used used to be the one that was the um nailed on who would play all the games so um yeah it's it's maybe po like but Walker before this season had been rotated massively too so um yeah maybe it's um Walker's turn to be crap again and someone like Diaz is gonna be the nailed on pick maybe they'll buy someone I I don't know they still got Rico Lewis and stuff like that so they they've got a lot of good Defenders haven't they so but I just think I think it's easy to well it was easy to overlook them because you know they were rotating and we didn't know or we didn't think we KN we knew who was going to play a lot but you know I think two of their Defenders finished in the sort of the top six so yeah I wonder if um Stones can save fit and see if he can become an option again because he was great yeah yeah it would be good it would be good and I suppose because that was a short one I'll just um I know do you want to do you want to go for one for players for next season um yeah we've kind of sort of talked about havs um he started at 7.5 million I think it was like ninth best scoring mid um but yeah game 34 to 38 no blanks at all um game 25 to 38 got 117 points only Palmer out scored him at that time 5.3 average points across the season uh .7 goal involvement average across all games and 23 goal contributions so he probably should be a serious Contender for our squads next year um around I would guess around 8 million um and probably going up to forward um so if we're looking at like Harland plus one other most of the time then that that might be Watkins but Watkins might go up by quite a lot so havitz could be that option instead um but at the same time like sacka and odard both had higher points in goal involvements compared to havs Across the season so and obviously sacka penalties odard seem to back up on penalties so maybe those two are still the the best options but but have at a forward um at around eight million could could be good yeah no I think he like I say if he does get moved to that that forward position he's definitely a a good option because his price isn't going to go up as as high as Watkins I suppose with Watkins at Viller he doesn't have like The Supporting Cast who are like his consistent Point returners like he is definitely the Talis man of that team whereas you're right sacka odard are still there and are good players who are going to score points as well and obviously take away bonus room but yeah I don't mind him if he was moved to a forward that'd be it would be quite a nice m shift I suppose yeah and then just finally for me someone who I never own this season but I always thought looked quite good when he wasn't injured so Coulda so he ended the season and started it at 5.5 million so he got injured in gameweek 23 but between gameweeks one and 23 he was the fifth highest scoring Striker after Watkins harand Alvarez and salanki basically players who were you know all more expensive than him and all having good Seasons as well but you know those players were also quite a lot more expensive than than him like Alvarez was the closest in terms of price but by gameweek 23 Alvarez was nearly sort 7 million so if you also look at mids who were priced 7 million or less at the start of the season the only two mids who' scored higher than him between game weeks one and 23 were Gordon and Palmer both of which I would expect to be higher priced than him next season so I kind of high maybe highlights like if you know again it's a huge huge if on on how well it gets um or how well the summer goes and what happens with Wolves but it sort of highlights that he could be better than any fifth midfielder and I doubt for his price goes beyond 6 million because it started at 5.5 and ended at 5.5 I don't know do you see that as well uh I think they'll put him at six million to be honest um but be beyond that no I don't think so six million seems fair and I think he he looks like you know when he plays he's a he's a good option for wolves and he returned like fairly well like when he came back from his injury as well even though he wasn't playing full 90 minutes he obviously wasn't 100% fit but yeah he was he was you know decent without being great at quite an affordable price yeah I think we saw when when Neto hang and him were all fit which was granted pretty um not often this season but when they did they they were good points returners he was getting goals like juang was getting goals n was n was getting returns I think Netto had something like eight weeks in a row or something where he got something um so yeah he will certainly be a good option there's no longer wolves just like a team you just never back for attackers like where they just couldn't score like that's that's not the thing anymore so um yeah if they get a good run of fixtures and he's he's at six million absolutely like he he will be an option for sure their backup Strikers were barely played like guy called Fraser in ch who I can't even say I knew anything about but they got like five and seven points they obviously shuffled their team around but yeah You' think unless they sign someone he's absolutely going to be First Choice again and then you'd expect him to play more minutes because well if he doesn't get this injury and his points per match were 4.2 so that was like one more than rashford was and yeah looks good he's a sort of um Striker he's a bit of a journeyman and so who knows if he actually stays um of wolves um because I don't know well I guess we'll see but I hope he does yeah even Netto play teams might look at Netto possibly assuming like they need him to stay fit of course but um yeah he's proved himself to be um sort of doable and and make lots of goals and chances and score points in this league so yeah teams may start looking at him he seems like a sort of lipol Target and Netto doesn't he yeah absolutely yeah I think there probably will be some [ __ ] I mean Netto had such a good early part of the Season that he was talked about so much that I wouldn't be surprised if he he did get sold this summer for just in that financial difficulty yeah and just finally for me just to to end the show um branway I thought had such a great season he came in from game two and then pretty much played all games from that and he was 4 million I think he started at yeah um so yeah uh naon good defensive foundations with a team that don't seem to score much so he's good on bonus um he was the fifth highest scoring Defender 12 clean sheets for for Everton three goals one assists as well so he he had some decent attacking potential too he got 10 bonus like for me like if he stays um at Everton because I think like teams are certainly looking at him now if he stays probably gonna be 4.5 million I think five would be possible too but like yeah he should be a solid pick for good home fites um for to you know hopefully to be able to rotate in um and has attacking potential as said so so yeah when it's when it's good fixtures I think he'll be a good pick next season like he was this year no I agree I like BR for I obviously had him from like game 30 32 and he was a bit of a hero and 34 and got me a couple of other clean sheets as well but kept returning yeah he was good he was good neverton were good cool all right I think that pretty much W wraps up the season chat sports say we will we be doing a Euro fantasy league we will be but I don't think we will be streaming about it or chatting about it we'll see yeah yeah we'll probably make a league put it in on Twitter but I doubt we um yeah we're not going to do any content for I don't imagine don't think so no we'll put we'll put a link out there for people to join if they do want us to follow us on on Twitter um if not already we could do a really quick Geo content now I want England to win Kieran who do you want to win well England of course um yeah I I think it'll be interesting um Italy players probably not as good as last time um other than that pick get get three England um well to be honest I think England's group is kind of difficult um but we should be being them all um Germany's group is sort of um kind of open I think Germany aren't that great so I think that's sort of a place where you can look at differentials like Switzerland are in that group you've done some research haven't you have you been I've listened to one I've listened to one podcast did and it was about group a right okay um so so yeah I think um there's like a four million starting Germany look right back we're not doing this is content I know million starting Germany right bag called um MIT slat or something iide God I'm unprepared there you go that's um that's your who winning that's your team right there who okay I got a good one um who's G to be this is just interesting who would be your top three England player picks for the Euro fantasy or um okay you got a assumably Kane but he'll be really expensive I think Bellingham probably round about 10 million I guess probably pretty good um and then sackin let oh God you going triple England attack you love these double and tripl I was thinking pford for the save points yeah Pickford should be good um it's just who's going to start in the defense like Stone's gonna stay fit Stones should be good if he stays fit yeah my man KL Walker maybe oh yeah of course yeah I wonder what he' be priced at like five million seems fair CU he might play we got all this issue we're talking about England tactics now but looking at that team sheo and what said yesterday about how they a bit of a lack of left backs I wonder if they might he might play like 3 43 and then he can play like I don't know three center backs let's say Walker Maguire and braithway if Stones isn't back or conso any number of them and then he could just play I don't know sacka would work hard on one side and fodm would definitely not foden uh Gordon would definitely work uh hard on the other side so there you go look chat sports happy we should just clip this this is just our Euro content bit I'll be I'll be interesting to see who misses out of the attackers um I'm imagine it'll be Palmer um which is a shame because saaka will have to play Fon will have to play Kane has to play Bellingham has to play so um yeah I I think the defense yeah is chort says pford probably will be busy like the defense is going to be a bit of an issue but the attack should score lots of goals you hope so hope so yeah exciting all right we better wrap it up there I thought this was going to be a short show tonight this has been one of my favorite shows of the season I like just dissing all the players oh yeah it's good that it's over and the the stress of every week is gone yeah less stress I'm definitely turning my phone off before deadline I think that some while season I'm just going to roll with it I hate I hate deadlines now with all these leagues anyway all right on that happy note we we'll be back obviously when the prices drop I don't think we're going to do a fixtur show are we we're not that c who knows F on 19th of June so Jes I know right it's less than a month we'll be playing old ring then yes all right thanks everyone for joining us hope you had a great season it sounds like you all did some high ranks in the chat which is lovely to see so um yeah we'll see you in a month",11575

can you hear me now right brilliant start to a a stream it's brilliant isn't it right here we go and I've gone to the wrong page as well always start on a positive note Ray always start on a positive note and I completely messed that intro up hello everybody and welcome to the latest Elite FPL stream with myself steo and Ray where we will be going through all today's football matches looking how it's impacted FPL how much it's either made me happy sad annoyed blah blah blah blah blah uh as we know ra doesn't actually play FPL but it doesn't matter he's got a very inform informative opinion and knowledgeable opinion about football in general so any questions for Ray get them in the chat I'll be able to read them out to him as we're going through each match that's happened today on Saturday the 24th of August I'm going to be honest you may notice that I'm wearing a dressing gown I am feeling generally really really ill if I'd have had a bad game week Ray I generally would not be doing this stream but because I'm a fraud I just fought to hell with it I'll chat with Ray for an hour or so about what's happened today so I just want to quickly kick off by saying hello to some people that joined us in the chat those people being as we quickly say hello to them are as follows we have kickers Taste of chaos rad Kevin Kelly PK Ser animation zimy Ray kesi is here um Andrew Ferguson he finally followed us on X I mean l me finally followed us on x um Alexander mcbrien of course if you are brand new around here make sure you're hitting that subscribe button and make sure you're hitting the like button and make sure as Ash says you're sharing the stream that's the important thing I was got to share r i was got to share Troy cadogan again welcome all these people what no Graphics I thought what no Graphics deserted us Ray for a certain stream called Planet FPL but he's back all of a sudden must be having a good game week R to be honest with you yes we'll get on to that in a minute Natasha good evening David Hil fbl Maestro col I want to be speaking not literally speaking to you but I will be speaking to you later about Fulham assets but we'll get on to that when we come on to their game probably last so Ray let's crack on we've just seen the game between well I've seen the second half between ulot Arsenal versus Aston Villa at Villa Park I'll be completely honest with you Ray you did a smash and grab job trossard and reyer got you through the second half you genuinely must be a very very happy Arsenal fan coming away with three points from V absolutely absolutely I kind of predicted it would be a bit KY it wouldn't be a kamakazi kind of performance from either team there's a lot of respect there there's start the season as well you kind of just want to get points on the you know on the board and you know if I'll just go into the game really I mean the lineup was what I predicted I predicted Timber would come in at left back because he is Def defensively a lot more sound zenko and Bailey is fantastic in one onone situation so the first half nothing was really happening really they were both you know Villa were happy to chy kind of sit back in two Banks of four if you like but still a bit Advanced and Arsenal was just happy to pass and try and basically draw in Aston Villa and it it wasn't happening then suddenly sacka had an opportunity where you know he did the typical cut in and curly and Martinez saved brilliantly and then Gabrielle kind of mocked around at the back which he's done before I remember specifically did season before last with mitovich you know he tries to overpower him got intercepted ball got squared from Morgan Rogers who was brilliant on the day by the way he dominated Ryon party uh he he basically laid it on a plate for Watkins and Watkins dragged it wide and it was just unreal like I couldn't believe the error we made and then basically I think both teams just want halime to come and the second half see though it was very much going the same way neither team was really you know finding the impetus to go and try and win the game until Aston Villa actually tried to win the game if that makes sense and it was an incredible incredible moment where I think it was 58 minutes or something like that uh Onana had I think it was onani had a deflected shot it hit the bar Ry already committed himself on the rebound Watkins dived in for head and R made this unbelievable Instinct instinctive save it was absolutely phenomenal I can I just interject that I find it of course really bad from my point of view that I'm wanting Arsenal to they'll be challenging for the title but I obviously want them to Dethrone Man City but there's this I know everybody watching this is exactly the same the people with that with either a zero in fact to hell with it anybody that hasn't got any Aral Defenders like myself all I was thinking is please let ason Villa score please let ason Villa score I don't care if Arsenal wins 61 just let them score it's pathetic I saw someone I think it's sure it's Al FPL alpl whatever Alia he actually has I'm sure it's him has triple Arsenal defense there's someone in the community that has triple Arsenal defense they got reyer I think it's Ben White and Cela something like that but he's definitely got raying goal and then two Arsenal Defenders yeah and all I'm thinking is please askon for a score please askon for a score olle Watkins he doesn't look when I say match fit I don't mean in the sense of he isn't cardio ready or whatnot he just seems to be I don't know not being able to hit the back of the net like he normally would am I going completely mad here he didn't get he didn't get a preseason I think he only played maybe 15 or 20 minutes of their final game and started against Aston Villa and got subbed for I believe Duran and the exact same thing happened here he definitely was not his normal he wasn't mat sharp let's be honest he he's such a wonderful player but you know he needs minutes to be honest uh with you and apart from those two opportunities sack and uh sorry celba and Gabrielle handled him really well celba was absolutely brilliant on the day he was he was fantastic as he needed to be but so when that opportunity was save stroke Miss because Watkins should have put it in the corner but you know a lot of respect to how good the save was that really just you know lit up the game you know now the crowd started to get into it Arsenal started to get into it and trar changed the game and you know I have discussions with multiple Arsenal fans as well and I say you know I'd play Martinelli but trossard is the better player right now he's the player in form he's the player who's more te technically and tactically astute for artetta when he plays he cuts in Havoc doesn't mind going out wi that's exactly what happened the moment he came on he changed the game and he's our best finisher at the club as well so after today's game I'm just thinking he should play every game now going forward because Martinelli has not been right for pretty much 12 months now and we can't keep this sounds really disrespectful but we can't keep carrying him until he gets form because if trar didn't come on today I don't think we' win the game well he's always going to come on isn't he yeah sure but if he was injured for argument sake or if he was Ill like me he's not going to be playing and what who for argument sake trossard isn't available who comes on for Martinelli instead is it Vie J okay yeah so I do agree with you there's something about trossard which it's a more more M I think Gary Neville said it really there's more of a maturity about him he seems I mean he's what 27 trossard Martinelli 22 23 precisely yeah so he's got a lot more in the game than Martinelli so to speak even though Martin ell's been around since about the age of 14 it seems it's it's a ludicrous career for the for the he's Brazilian isn't he MH he's prison in yeah so he seems to have been around forever and for me Martin Elliot is funny cuz someone on in fact it was yarm or right on one of the chain wrestling guys messaged me on X to say or what do you think of Kio show from Burnley going to walles and I went y brilliant young exciting talent and he's and he just replied with oh that's good to he and I went well if you like tricks and Spins you're great but an end product just isn't there and I I feel that with Martin Elli he's got everything but when it comes to like an end product where it's the cross or the the shot just doesn't seem to end up in a in a in a positive way whereas with M trossard everything seems to just click like that it's it's certainly something in which arteta should be looking at and going you know what maybe I should like you said switch it around a bit have trar starting and Martinelli coming on as an impact yeah most certainly I mean the end of last season that's basically what was happening trossard was in the first team and he was returning steo he's actually scoring goals key goals and making assists and again a fantastic system player with havs he and havs really Duff tail brilliantly together like really really well and you know I can understand why we're playing Martinelli because his ceiling is still so high what he did season before last but you can't keep like you said you can't keep going on you know almost a for of Glory I mean we'll get to the game later but in a way it's a bit like rashford as well is that you know the talent is there the ability is there all the core mechanics are there of being a elite player but you know you can't keep carrying these individuals you know like Trad has earned his spot he should play he has the shirt for me so yeah and and then Martinelli is an incredible impact player himself if you're playing against a tire defense what a player to bring on isn't it to kind of um you know take advantage of that High Line when teams are chasing so sure it's not great for Martinelli maybe short term but you know in my opinion it's just trust out end his spot just to yeah be pretty Frank I mean I predicted on the super Brew 2N ended 2-n and you have the next few fixtures are very very difficult for you guys in the sense of you have got uh Brighton at home to be honest that's actually pretty easy ray then you got Tottenham away which is a derby game I expect you to win Man City away which is going to end up being the usual 1 one no no this is when I'm going to be jumping on Arsenal for myself it's from game week six that game week Leicester Southampton for of Liverpool I'm trying my hardest to hold it's the same with as Villa to be honest with you I I've got a dilemma we'll get on to fpl in a minute but I've got a D in my head it's not really a dilemma I need to be getting on Aston Villa they did show me a lot today where I feel I do need an asset admitt I've got Martinez really annoyed that he let that party was it party that scored the second goal or Timber yeah it was he should yeah letting that slip through was just really frustrating from my point of view because that turn from him getting three points I believe to now one but he couldn't do anything about the first goal that one he could but with Aston Villa for me in the big games they seem like they're just going to sit back sit back sit back and try and hit on the counter which they kind of showed for me in the second half anyway of of that particular game against teams like Leicester or whatnot they're the ones that need to be creative ones and they have got the talent there the likes of tons Rogers Bailey to name three Watkins Jan they have got the quality of player to be able to open up teams like Leicester sth Hampton Etc I want to jump on them as quickly as possible I'm not interested in Watkins this is Morgan Rogers I'm very interested in yeah Matson is another one I know he didn't start today and I really do think that emray needs to be starting ahead of DEA Matson is an extraordinary attacking left wing back his delivery of the ball is almost pinpoint he just wants to get forward now obviously UNR you know he's wanting a player that can also perform defensive duties I get that if Matson was an absolute guaranteed starter I would have him in my team no matter what unfortunately he's not a guaranteed star so I'm looking for that Aston Villa player that I want which is going to be Rogers this specific case but Rogers look was there any players that you saw in that game that even you may even considered particularly looking at when it comes to Telegraph yeah that player is Morgan Rogers steo he was absolutely brilliant from driving from the Central and Midfield and getting that our back four when when I say he dominated party and rice he did pretty much by himself at times it was it was quite incredible how many times he Shrugged off part you know and party's a strong player himself in his own right but Morgan Rogers was driving so well that I think he is Central to a lot of creativity that they have from the central areas so I don't actually worry that Morgan Rogers is at risk and obviously in FPL he's he's five million it's like all right well I'll bench him but he is I cannot see him being benched anytime soon okay after the Leicester game it's the international break and then I believe the Champions League game comes in between gameweek four and five so I understand that aspect but so much of what Aston Villa do they look for Rogers which is just huge credit for him so I would say Rogers is definitely a player that I would look at in any Fantasy game actually the problem with Matson is D played really well today like he handled sacka very very well and can I see Matson eventually getting through absolutely absolutely because a bit like yourself I mean you'll know more because it was time at Burnley but he's a top top player so I think it's inevitable he'll getting that 11 but I can't see it happening in my opinion anytime soon and you already have a Defender a defensive cover as well so maybe a Rogers would be the way to go or even a Bailey because since Di's left now I just feel like Bailey will pretty much Start every single game and he had dangerous moments again today and the thing about Asen Villa they just have good players and emy's done a great job like you know we spoke about last week so if you said give me your top three Ray I'd say Rogers coner because I think you'll play every single game and he's very affordable and then Bailey a bit like yourself I'd wait with Watkins I know the fixtures are brilliant but he's not Matt Sharp it's funny mention Matt Shar because that's exactly what Andrew Ferguson's put there Watkins isn't Matt Sharp but V have lovely fixtures I have Rogers myself and like what I've seen so far for me people that have got to Rogers gameweek One SL start of the game SL start of the Season they're in an amazing position for people like me that felt that I'm a bit concerned about his minutes I've re-evaluated and realized no this player is exactly what a lot of the Aston Villa fans have been saying which is no he's going to be an incredible talent and you watch this season he's going to be the Breakthrough star of Aston Villa I've watched one game of his I found out from last week that he was very very good in the West Ham game and those fixtures I can't look past and to be completely Frank Ray my transfer on the top of my head right this second is him in for anunu I think anybody that's brought in Inu like me We all thought with foresight that oh he's going to be playing in this position Chelsea are going to be this type of Team etc etc hasn't worked out that well so far yes he scored a penalty against some team that I couldn't even tell you what their name is I couldn't really care less he's been T his minutes are being managed at the moment in the game against Man City admittedly he performed Abberly just patronizing this he's got a game against wolves I haven't started him I started Smith row ahead of him with hindsight of course I'd rather have started Inu ahead of mooners but for me if anunu tomorrow blanks comes off before the 58th minute my transfer immediately is going to be Rogers out in for en kunu and then then I'll be looking at Anthony Gordon so if I bring up my team I'm going to do I'm going to do a mark Southerns let me bring up my team so people can see exactly what we're talking about here what I'm talking about here so what I'll be doing looking at Anthony Gordon tomorrow because I'll be watching the games lying in my bed dying and I will be seeing if this guy actually produces what I would expect him to produce which is forward runs an attacking start of play where I'm like hold on a minute here I'm very optimistic with him especially going into the Tottenham fixture because Tottenham are there to be got at especially when Newcastle are at home yeah all accounts they did absolute garbage against Southampton to be honest with you last week in the one-nil win but for me I'll be honest with you Ray I was really really really really tempted to do a minus four today to avoid the price rise of sah and do sun and kungu and who's the other one there's another player I've completely for oh um was it Smith row I don't think it was Smith row munis it was Smith row Sun Smith row and Sun out for Salah rogersi and son you just said sorry yeah and Rogers out for andu Salah and Rogers but I'm thinking steo are you really that desperate to be bringing inan no is the answer is no I will hold my hands up but I've made a mistake with sun I don't care that he scored two goals today Everton were there for the taking today and they came away with 4 nil but according to talk sport specifically Troy Dei he said that seriously if salanki was on the pitch oh my God they're winning 678 nil they didn't they ended up winning four the sun goal I don't know if you've seen the sun goal it is how the how the hell he squeezed that through hickford is beyond me yeah by fortuitous luck he did I'm very very lucky to own son this game week a nick of fbl juice of course a guest on Wednesday he Captain son the captain son and for me I just I think bringing in Rogers for and kungu could be the move for me this week gen could be the move this week because in kungu if he planks tomorrow which I'll be honest with you Ray wouldn't surprise me I would expect that to be almost the the the the perfect move because Chelsea are going through a lot of change we've heard all the talk in the media about what's going on behind the scenes that's not exactly good for any any team to be going through at the moment a bit like Burnley at the moment that's a different podcast for a different day or a different stream for a different day there the ridiculous circumstances burle are in at the moment how we only lost one nil today is beyond me whatever Chelsea's upcoming fixures Crystal Palace at home where e whisper it quietly Ray as he's going to come out with a very very good Hall against somebody in the next three fixtures yeah probably leester at home or man united because he's another player Ray the for for two free transfers it could be depending on how Gordon plays tomorrow it could be just e and Rogers in for and kungu and Gordon and maybe maybe Smith row but I'm kind of holding on to Smith row with a very very good fixture up coming next in nip which I say a very good fixture actually I don't think it is I don't think he's that great so I'm kind of willing to come off Smith row if if and when necessary because I I I'm more faithful in in Aston Villa I have more faith in them as a team Chelsea on the other hand Crystal Palace at home I can't think of the school I read 2111 something like that then we've got Bournemouth away West Ham away horrible fixture Brighton at home no not great and then Nottingham Forest at home not great they're all green on the ticker for the FPL game I don't think they're green at all I think there's a lot of Grays in there for Chelsea as it stands as we speak Aston Villa on the other hand Lester away fantastic fixture Everton at home they're the whipping boys Wolves at home we'll find out tomorrow how they perform against Chelsea but Aston Villa will win that IP switch away I think they comfortably beat IP switch Man United at home easy fixture ful them away that looks like it's got goals in it and then Bournemouth at home I mean it would in the telegraph game other than Rogers have you thought about potentially even tripling up or is it just literally because you've only got the 40 transfers just stick with the one asset from Aston Villa yeah Watkins is pretty expensive to be honest with you but he's the same price as Palmer so I've got almost very much fun enough with the same kind of thinking as you is that I've got Palmer from an EO perspective a bit likeu is highly owned with be more engaged players but if he doesn't perform against Chrystal Palace and I just see an absolute abomination of a performance let alone if these guys actually perform then I'd look to take him out and bring in a villa player so but everything you said regarding Villa I agree with I think they're the team that people going to hop on to but I think that was always going to be the premise anyway after this Arsenal game if I were to make a comment about your transfers I feel I like the latter plan that you said you know taking out Gordon taking out Inu and bringing in who was it it was Rogers and a and Rogers a and Rogers I I I love the moves and you're saving so much money aren't you you're you're going to come out with a bit of money left in there as well because those two latter assets are actually cheaper probably a lot cheaper actually because of how Rogers is only five million and then maybe hold that money and then see what you want to do after the Man United game I suppose at the moment you have two three transfers is that fair that's right yeah yeah there you go then I mean or you could just make the one transfer but again you were talking about value which I completely agree but e away to Chelsea I don't think a lot of people are bring him in I agree with that a lot of a lot of top players including yourself would say why would you be bringing in X player when they're performing them when they their next game is against a Prem like a a traditional top six team whatever we may think of Chelsea that's what they are and you are I mean anybody would say that's completely Bonkers getting bit of gon when they've got Tottenham at home next who again could potentially be a very highs scoring game I'm pretty certain that Newcastle enjoy playing Tottenham as well well mhm but I I think that from my point of view being a a sword no a shield sorry in the terminology of fantasy football scouts bringing in Rogers would probably be the wise move a lot of good managers have got Rogers and I think tomorrow watching I'm not going to be able to watch him but andu like I said looking ahead if he fails to do anything tomorrow I think I'm probably just going to do it immediately just getting gone because unu's price will fall I can't lose out on that 0.1 even though I can still get Rogers in easily but his transfers further down the line especially in the early stages and I think maybe going into gameweek three was still one free transfer then going into the international break then with two yep pretty good plan isn't it agree I I if if Kuku looks trash tomorrow or for any reason you know Mesa is still with his 47 players understanding what kind of dynamic and Squad he wants the 20 that he chooses for the for the game then I like the idea of as soon as the game ends I'm doing Inu to Rogers and that's it just the one change boom done and you know and then you have one and a half million in the bank isn't it because in kungu six and a half so you're like yep that's fine that's fine and then I have another free transfer and then I'll see what I want to do but then your team's well set up anyway because when you're talking about Smith row I didn't like that idea because no I don't like it particularly myself yeah it freeze up to 0 five from yeah my point of view and by all accounts he played very well today he gets his first goal that maybe a confidence booster so just want to quickly say there's a lot of people watching right now it'd be really cool if you guys are subscribing to the channel and making sure you're hitting the like button if you are enjoying the stream it really is grateful for myself and Jason and Ray in this case to make sure that he just showing some simple support by just hitting the like button it' be great just a few comments here we have Troy kod Cagan saying I have Bruno Fernandez and E in my team should I give them one more fixture each or get rid of them now so just to give you an idea of their fixtures Ray so we got Fernandez up against Liverpool next we've got e at home away at at Chelsea but then United at lunchtime kickoff 12:30 in gameweek four are up against Southampton and MES after the international break which as Mark goldbridge says never a good thing and then Crystal Palace are at home to Leicester which is a good thing I would for Fernandez they've got Southampton Crystal Palace Tottenham Aston Villa in the next five after well in the next four after Liverpool exactly I from my opinion if you're going to hold on to Fernandez it's the fact that he is the key man to everything man united do he's the best player on the pitch now ironically Ray I'm assuming you're aware he actually came off as a substitute would you believe for the first time I think ever yeah watch the whole game right okay we'll get on to that later he actually came off as a substitute and a lot of people tuning into the United stand and me listening to Mark goldbridge were just perplexed by why would you take Fernandez off now obviously he's not been taken off because he's a poor player he wasn't performing he's got injury but he is the key man to man united and me personally I would not be getting rid of E Yeah e or Bruno and I would still will give them that one more fixture and see how they come out of those games against Chelsea and Man United Liverpool respectively because who you going to bring in for Fernandez there's a littley of options really when you look at it because you know when even even in I'll just say fantasy yeah in fantasy football rather than say FPL and Telegraph it's just Bruno Fernandez a lot of people bought in and we're talking about for many elements you look at with fantasy football and I I was very I was very unsure because he's an expensive asset however you look at it okay maybe not premium in in FPL but he and erard are very similar they'll pick up the ball from really random areas to try and you know start the engine going you know you're quite right they're the main man for me Ard is the main man to start things creatively as is Bruno Fernandez but he's not a lot of the times he's not actually part of the goals and that's what Bruno was that's what was happening with Bruno last season and in this game today I didn't really see him in anything I mean we'll cover the game later but when I look at those fixtures you know as you said you know within the next five they got Liverpool Spurs and Villa at least on paper and Palace away is not going to be easy is that at that cost at eight and a half I believe he is yeah know it's the opportunity to maybe use that money and tap into Aston Villa tap into you know if you don't have Smith R for example which I can completely understand and you know maybe look at spreading those assets you could use that money maybe to get in a Man City player of some sort if foden is back in the fold or something like that or obviously completely drop him down to four and a half or five in Rogers funly enough and then maybe look to upgrade a forward so regarding Bruno I'm I'm the opposite of you that would be a player I'd be like yeah I wouldn't mind shifting out because of how much money he costs and I don't see a lot of outlet from him okay granted against Fulham it was unbelievable he should have got two goals yeah but but in this game he he wasn't really involved in anything creatively in regards to getting an assist or getting a goal e however how he hasn't got two or three goals in the last two games is unreal he is he's exactly what we assumed to be start of the Season he's the main man he's part of everything he's creating last week thought the disallowed goal was unfortunate I disagree with it maybe I'm being biased and today he smashed the bar from an unbelievable cut well an unbelievable shot outside the box smacked the bar and he was just he's a player you could keep all season seriously because just everything Palace do are going through him and he's s they're such a creative team now that whoever they play against Chelsea they'll create opportunities against Liverpool against Arsenal even against man city is e is a player that I feel like you could keep so with E I completely agree with you you can keep him for pretty much probably the next month and let's see what he's like but uh Bruno I'm unsure steo because Dio looks more dangerous than garnacha did when he comes on and eventually Gara will start games yeah Harry dwson who's a genuinely a very very good fbl player the loyal fan of this show he says that maybe getting rid of Fernandez for and burm brenford the problem with that is got next fixture next week sath Hampton at home cannot I cannot look past and [ __ ] that is a great what would you rather have Ray simple question would you rather have uro at home to Southampton or Fernandez at home to Liverpool of course uro but it's not a onewe game is it precisely because then it's then Man City away Tottenham away West Ham at home walls at home man united away IPS at home it's you men then don't you steo you bench him you I mean I wouldn't be wanting to bench someone like in Burma person way to Man City well it depends obviously who your backup is if your backup is Harry Winks I was thinking Rogers because he's only five of course if you if if you own Rogers yeah but I think that the fact that Burma's got those two horrible fixes yes Tottenham can be got at I think look at look at ammo tomorrow look at brenford tomorrow in fact against Liverpool I've got it as 3-0 I do not see brenford scoring at all the history suggests Liverpool we be will be winning to nil I think just look at look at andma tomorrow I know it's a a difficult fixture at Liverpool I'm not blind to that but if you're looking for a Fernandez replacement you can't go too wrong with with a [ __ ] talking of um the matches in fact just quickly I'll just quickly scroll through a few comments here from from the chat good evening Men In Black in fact he mentions about Mark senss tonight if you are around they're going to be doing a match of the day challenge and I'm telling you now all it will be is yeah well we knew the risk and uh and a lot of um um um um that's a good way to bring them on the show Ray yeah I'm actually in all seriousness I'm really looking forward to that match of the day challenges it's going to be a lot of fun in fact on screen at the moment I have actually got the the team what it would look like if I did do the ummo sorry ambero and kungu out for for Rogers and it would be a Midfield of Smith row Rogers swapping around with one another and then jot Gordon and Sun really for me tomorrow is the big one regarding Newcastle I really want to see them turn up and Anthony Gordon put shiff Ray yeah yeah I agree totally and having Gordon and esack was obviously a probably more of a short-term kind of aim for you because you want to attack the fitures which I completely understand but if Gordon doesn't perform tomorrow and comes off again and then you know you got someone like Harvey Barnes you know kind of kind of lurking down the wings isn't it is that you know it's kind of like okay well I tried you Gordon didn't work and now I can use you as a cash cow isn't it I love I love the rest of the Midfield I really do I love the sun shout I I think you know we were talking about it last week about let's give ourselves credit because we did all the planning we did all the checking you brought sun in Sun returned that's it you know if sun doesn't take the shot it doesn't go in a lot of players aren't as confident to do that and if you saw the second goal Pickford being pford for Everton is Sun Clos him down brilliantly so you know enjoy those points you deserved it and But ultimately again when my going with this is that with sun as well it's quite funny actually because it's almost like Sun versus Gordon of who you might look to take out isn't it because they're playing each other next week so I can only see one way there's only one way that outcome is coming and that's Gordon Gordon wins that that Newcastle game in my opinion is got again it depends on how they performed if if Newcastle come through that game tomorrow I've predicted 3-1 to Newcastle I expect them to concede they come through that game with Isaac and Gordon Murphy Harvey Barnes and various other players in their team looking really really sharp I'm thinking that game against Tottenham is he's got like in my head I've got like a 42 43 written all over it because we know how postao likes to set up it's just attack attack attack Newcastle can easily control that by just doing an Aston Villa hold back hold back bang go and with their pacy Wingers that could be a proper endtoend match in which we could be seeing lots of goals next week Ray on I believe it's on the Sunday kickoff I think it is I'm pretty certain it's the it's the Sunday kickoff so I am really am looking forward to how that that game will unfold Newcastle are different beasts now as well Ste because they play Hall and livero they are a lot more at least offensively expressive I don't think they're going to be as solid defensively as we've seen previously just based on the F on the resource that they have I think they're looking to get rid of tripier as well so I agree with you I think it could be a high-scoring go game like it could be a minimum of four goals because I don't think Newcastle will be as cute to be defensive now because they got so so many attacking Assets Now even in defensive areas so I agree with you yeah yeah yeah the game's literally just updated in the last 10 minutes um I'm just going to quickly go through my team as it stands right now its points and let us know in the chat how you getting on with your teams any any hanen triple Captain as I know Dale in my personal friend of mine he triple Captain Ash if he's watching he's not he triple Captain hland I believe FPL focal blood of course I am did pretty crap on the quiz though Ray great oh yeah oh yeah yeah we should have that we should have a segment of that today well I'm kind of how bad he was well to be to be fair I'll be I mean this wasn't disuss I whenever we do predict whether it's with you whether it's with Dan whether it's with Jason I always like to do like an impromptu quiz because it just kind of gives you an idea of History I guess yes sir and I like it's just like you said about on the voice message you went it's a bit of an icebreaker yeah and it got the best out of Ash to be honest with you I really not that he was but I really enjoyed when he was getting a bit frustrated because let's get real here whenever he's on ju and he's doing some form of quiz about football is he always seems to do pretty well I know no no completely I completely agree that when you talked about January 2023 and he was like yeah it was our season and he was like January 2023 I laugh so much I was like you're so dumbass seriously a brother to help you out so I'm looking forward to because what I want to do is not that it's going to be a reg well I say not going to be a regular thing make a leaderboard for anybody listening in I am trying to every Wednesday get on a guest and Nick's gonna be coming on next week I've already got an idea who I went on game week three if she is watching hopefully she does join us so that's up to game week three and then game week four I have another guest in mine who he I think should be happy to join us as well because he's always asking when when on Earth can I come onto a stream and I'm just a lazy G that I have to think about Jason as well how we can fit in the time and whatnot but anyway we're going completely sidetracker so my team in full is Martinez in goal he got me a whopping one point didn't even get me a save point if only saved that Bloody party shot I would have got that we then have vardo poro Robinson oh Robinson got some bonus Point did he good he got an assist man well I know he got an assist he also got bonus Point okay which is very very good uh sun on 16 Smith row on 10 moon is two hen captain and then Isaac so what I've got left is Gordon jot Isaac and it's pretty much the same combination for a lot of people instead of jot they've got Salah instead of Gordon they've got anunu I've got Smith row they may have andu whatever but certainly I'm we we've all come out of it really well like I said Howen Captain is an extra 17 points on top of that so if I had have triple captained ham which I never would have thought I would have done I'm glad people did take my advice perfect fixture um in the Tob Elite I've gone up to Second spot in the moderator League I'm up to fourth so yeah I I mean with with Jason's team as it stands right now as it stands right this second I'm I'm nine points ahead of him it's there's nothing in it at the moment between myself and Jason he still has though Trent Alexander Arnold Guaranteed Clean sheet Lewis Hall he's then got yeah so it's it's Trent Alexander and Fernandez sorry Trent Alexander Arnold and Hall versus Gordon in this in this in this case between myself and Jason Jason having today having Henderson differentials that is Henderson e HZ and Fernandez and Gib Gibbs white he had Ray very I'm not going to lie Forest they deserve to win there's no denying in fact I was told that Southampton I was told I was listening on the radio and they basically said that Southampton could be playing till their next their next home fixture and they still wouldn't score that's how bad they were yeah when I heard Gibbs white typical but overall in in the mini leagues so far so good I am dreading the Liverpool match tomorrow I am expecting Liverpool to win pretty comfortably I don't know the direct history between Salah and brenford he does okay Liverpool though do very I think he's got five goals and maybe an assist in six games or something like that great that's not a good thing um at all I don't that's why I'm here that's one I don't want to be hearing that Clare FPL good evening she says I've got Salah Isaac and Anu great great option specifically in Sala and and kunu like I said it's not I don't know if you're aware of this statistic woles are unbeaten I believe in eight matches versus wo versus Chelsea wow something like that at home I believe it is amazing yeah they would have they would have faced some incredible Chelsea sides as well when Chelsea were you know like Drogba and Robin and these kind of players so that's a fantastic record yeah CL CLA saying here Southampton were lame I I think you're being very very kind there CLA they were [ __ ] um I was at the match I saw that in the Discord she put up a nice picture of where she was at and uh I played Hudson the DOI and I benched Harwood Bellis and yeah again we'll get on to the match in the minute I was surprised by that that specific result Martin solden saying here that things go right after my plan for me it was always Salah or triple Captain hland game week two went hland made my first transfer of the year to and Burma who did you bring in for who did you get rid of for and Burma Martin that would be interesting to hear um animation saying he's got triple Newcastle and Salah left you're going to have to be hoping that you're going to be you're going to be have to be hoping that Newcastle do very well against Bourn with pk7 saying just imagine if you had done those transfers you were thinking of glad you didn't Jesus that would have been rough I can't remember what I was going to do pk7 remind me in the chat can you even remember what I was doing I said it on patreon on Ray I cannot remember no I don't remember nor can I they let me know pk7 whether it's DM or on here right now uh Chris tinson saying the trouble is Southampton hav any actual Premiership Premier League quality players in the transfer window yeah unfortunately with a lot of these teams that come up they they go for proven Championship players Because deep deep down they know they're going to get relegated so they just buying Championship quality players to then come straight back up we have a 91 Point with Martin King uh 91 points with jot van djk Isaac and Murphy left to play that's if Murphy gets on the pitch he should do Milos good evening Andrew Ferguson yep you've got the the answer correct there even though I didn't actually ask a question uh Gio saying evening Lads I'm looking at matoma to replace Gordon next week matoma interesting I wouldn't BL oh dear we got English English lessons problems here Gio we'll just stick with um replacing matoma sorry Gordon with matoma Ray I'll just give you an idea of Brighton's fixtures before you think about that so he's saying got open I got them open okay go for yeah I mean Arsenal away terrible i' just hold but then it switch at home for us at home I absolutely adore so just wait an extra week G wait an extra week and uh please use full stops in the right area exactly I have to say Jason if if you're listening in which he won't be I'm loving my new setup on OBS it is absolutely Sublime people can actually see what I want them to be looking at basically so I've just got the fixtures up on screen at the moment and it just makes it for a more better enjoyable interactive experience with the audience Ray of more better visual experience that's what we put the non-existent patreon money towards talk Talking of patreon everybody in all seriousness um on the 28th of August which is in 4 days time patreon will be going to back to payments I may I'm I'm probably going to pause it because we've got International break coming up so I'm probably naturual fact now saying out loud I'm probably going to reinstall payments for patreon on gameweek four so the week whenever that week is I'll be reinstalling the patreon payments with that you get additional bonus podcasts and you also get to be put into a trophy league and that's with the 499 tier if you want to just say thank you guys for the streams that you put on you can simply do the 199 option at the moment it's free so a lot of people are saying to me Steve I can't sign up what's going on it's because you're not going on to the free section so on patreon I know how it works but I'm assuming it just says do you want to join up for free sign up for $1 199 $4.99 if you choose any of the payment options it's not going to accept it where if you just ch free and then once we announce when the patreon is going to be up and running for payments that's when if you choose to you can sign up to patreon with whatever donation you feel like it and the game week four will be when the trophy League actually starts I'm just quickly looking so thank you for that and just to make sure anybody listening in now make sure you are hitting the Subscribe button hitting the like button myself and Jason are very very grateful looking at the the the the history tracker the fixture tracker here right um some teams which have got big green lights is the aforementioned Chelsea but like I said I think they're still going through a phase now of of rebuilding and I think that their manager is wondering hm how do I get this system to work but we'll find out tomorrow how well they do Aston Villa massive green light we both agree that going forward you need to have a minimum of maybe two we then have Fulham who they got a 2-1 Victory against Leicester by all accounts in fact I saw it the goal came from a set piece but Leicester just were not at the gates at all so we were robbed of a clean sheet but whatever they've got IP switch away and then it's right now we need to reevaluate whatever they do at IP switch is going to be for me the end of moon is or not who coincidentally if you're aware if you're aware or not Ray went up by 0.1 last night because they all brought him in for sanky we then have IPS witch whose fixtures Fulham Brighton Southampton ason Villa so they've got some kind of Championship type matches upcoming in those three but the diff the problem is is that fulam and Brighton are now real proper established Premier League teams and they're going to find that very very difficult we then have Notting Forest still got some okay fixtures woles Liverpool then Brighton and Fulham not too bad so a lot of the the more mediocre teams really with some decent fixtures but players that we don't really want to be looking at but the players that we've got at the moment I think a lot of people can just hold I don't know what Jason will be thinking we've all got two a lot of us have got two free transfers and for me I think I am probably just going to do that get rid of UNC and bring in Rogers or maybe depending on Gordon situation maybe but I think it's probably going to be andu I mean we've got Martin saying here I'm gonna be doing Joe Linton to [ __ ] Martin how on Earth do you own and Burma what what is what the hell is that all about I just why in Earth you had Joe Linton I have no idea Peak Paul saying here it was going to be sun to foden and Smith wrad to somebody oh yeah can I just get this little rant off my chest just quickly Ray is that is that okay you you'll be able to get your own two cents in on this so a very um large x account now I don't know if it was a serious post or not and you're probably going to say steo you've been juked it wasn't a serious post it was it was it was a joke hilarious this particular individual who's notorious for uh Manchester City Le he put out the fact that he's going to be setting up a patreon for essentially team leaks I'm assuming it was a joke a lot of people didn't think it was a joke but I'm kind of getting sick to death of this whole thing of any team leakers getting clout because they can get some news that a certain particular individual which yes I get it helps a very small part of the community you know if if we talking deadline day we've got roughly at the precise moment deadline's about to happen at about say 25 11 and information's released you've got what I would say 50,000 people in total tuning into the various streams that are going on deadline date maybe up to 60,000 and for that small amount of people and and also of course you have to take in account X as well I get that so let's just say 100,000 people have got privilege to leaks in the make but this individual saying that he wants to charge on patreon again I think it was just a joke but I find it Grim that your whole Persona is just a you releasing the fact that boden's benched for argument say now ironically it's really good information but to come out and say I'm going to charge a patreon which again I think may be a joke again it's really not that funny what do you think on the whole leaks side of things uh it definitely contributed in obviously my decision we definitely had one thing because I was stressing over leaks but okay hub for example yeah Hub fine I know a few of the guys it's all good but it's like okay some people actually pay a subscription to get team reveals from some of the top managers now through that charge and everything I'm sure the actual FBO manager probably gets a kickback and stuff like that and I actually do not mind it compared to how I probably was 12 years ago sorry 12 months ago probably how I was feeling 12 months ago because I'm offering you a service and it's your decision if you would actually like to contribute into a patreon for me because when I am getting these leaks for you you're then able to make a decision to help your team and what am I getting out of it you know if I'm looking from the other side of the person so however the problem with leaks obviously is that they're not Ironclad there have been moments where they've got it wrong like a couple of them have got it wrong and I won't quote them because you haven't quoted so I won't quote but a couple of big ones have got it wrong and have come back and said oh I got it last minute that he did get on the bus so then feel it's more the the person pay the contributor in my opinion is more the person who's being duped and is more the person that maybe needs to be chastised rather than the person offering the service in my opinion in this case I was thinking cynically that what stops me from signing up to a person's patreon or whatever and getting the leaked news setting up a fake account on X and then releasing the same information for free just to get clout on X or social media I just I I just find sad personally I think I think that someone like yourself who built up a a large following on X because you provided a service regarding the spaces there's there's a form of um what's the bloody word I'm looking for it's um help me out here R you're an intelligent bloke you've built it up from a is it an Integrity point of view integ yeah yeah I'd like to say I advocated Integrity absolutely yeah whereas these other accounts you know they get one leak right and it's oh my god let's all follow this person and I'm willing to anyway I just sort I think it was a joke though but again it's not be surprised if it's seriousy though because if there are a few I can think of Man City one guy specifically who pretty much gets it right every single time but he's extremely intelligent because he does it in such a way that these are the players I've definitely got who I definitely started and some of these guys are 50/50 6040 and if he says I'm GNA open up a patreon with this news and release it earlier a good 20 minutes before the servers go down is I can't I can't knock him sio from a business point of view maybe from a ethical point of view I can definitely understand where you're coming from I can understand where you're coming from but you know if I have an opportunity to make whatever it is on patreon and so many like you said so many people think about it when you look at Harry when you look at Raptor when you look at Andy they get this news as well and therefore more people are going to be probably joining their stream as well and thinking okay this is the time where I might get my leak from these you know pretty renowned content creators so if Ray Ki is giving Arsenal leaks and stuff like that and I'm providing it for free and they are probably obviously getting some kind of you know kick back with more viewers and more likes and you know the whole Shang you know better than me is that I'll say you know what let me put on a patreon and see if I can earn money from this yeah exactly I think like you I think you agree that I think we both agree that it's the people that would sign up for it it's tragic but anyway talking to free like I said you can sign up to our patreon for free and hopefully entices you to maybe contribute to the show financially who knows um Mar solden here saying the gameweek transfer regarding Joe Linton is it's to and bermo and then the following week it's going to be in burm to e Martin genuinely go for it a great idea brilliant idea I think and that's a really really good plan podner saying if the content creator are get more money money why shouldn't the guy and I think he's just going to pretty much say what you just said just take advantage of no disrespect but idiots that want to ruin the game it's a bit like Nick trigger lips regarding his video and in fact did you watch that no you wouldn't have there I didn't no but I should well you aware of the only person yes I'm aware of it right so it's hilarious I will what I'll do is I may send it to you afterwards and just send you the point where you need to watch it from it's just hilarious how AI is just kind of slowly taking over the world of fantasy football and there's a lot of teams that are very very similar because of what an AI bot is is recommending and anyhow we could be all day um talking we've reviewed we've we've vied one fixture and it's been an hour what was the fixture oh Arsenal yeah the the smash and grab yeah in fact I don't even know if asked you the question do you agree with me that it was for you a smash and grab yeah absolutely uh we we I I I never go in and think Arsenal play for results because I think we're just a different Beast now we're a top team but we played the game to not lose and and and I think a lot of that is credit to to Villa absolutely they are top team their their tactical setup is really impressive they know how to press and then they know how to obviously pop pop out as well and the likes of tians has become such a top player like he was for Leicester now I'm really happy for him because I've always liked him as a player but I think just when the opportunity obviously arise and Truss i' obviously put an injection of more quality on the ball is that's when we legit smashed and grabbed the correct result for me was a draw at best for Arsenal I think overall if you really break down the game before the goal I think Asen Villa probably shaded it but a draw would have been the right result so this is very much like a one of those cliche this is what Champions do you know they win when they're not playing well away from home and that's really what it was it's a sign of Champions as Dan likes to say as a signing Champion so q& TV who is stepen I know a steveo he's he's 1500th in the world Ray we got a we got a humble brag there Ray very very good hi Stephen yeah yeah yeah Gio saying there tons is my favorite player I just want to quickly say just before we get onto the matches which we're going to do in about two seconds before I do this quick plug this stream thanks to Ray it's got nothing to do with me thanks to Ray over there is why these streams are happening and these will be happening every single weekend at 8:00 p.m. there will be occasions when Ry unfortunately can't join me due to personal matters but please make sure you're tuning in every single week every Saturday 8:00 pm where myself and a guest will be covering the matches and just chatting nonsense like we are now so there's a lot of people watching right now really do appreciate it and make sure if you are enjoying it you're hitting the like button so moving on to the matches Ray you said you watched the man united fixture which is the first match that happened today I'll just give you a quick overview from what I could tell from Mark goldbridge is that and I know podner and there are various other people that think that Mark goldbridge speaks absolute twaddle which is fine and that's their opinion maybe when it comes to man united he may speak absolute twaddle but I think from a footballing perspective I think that he has got the nouse and he's just more perplexed at the the team selection the player selection whatever you want to call it I think if man united came away with gacho having that goal allowed I mean bloody out xer a knee on it I mean Blood come on you know but it was disallowed and then eventually of all the freaking players Ray sh bloody Pedro pops up so we had Welbeck and Pedro for Brighton with and a dingra another isn't it funny Ray we joked last week about you waffling on about and banging on about Bloody late you know 12 months later he's finally performing and you would have been seen as a God but unfortunately it's come too soon of course the assist to ahmed's goal was mazari we have the bonus points coming in it was wellbe three to Delow who by all accounts on the sky SWS headline highlights was performing really well absolutely today I predicted two one I did expect Brighton to win today Ray you watched you said you watched the game fair result should it have ended 1-1 should actually man united deserve to win yeah I in a very different way to the astonvilla Arsenal game this was a pretty open creative game actually like it was a lot of fun to watch and I I predicted 1 on super brew and I thought looking at the match like yeah this could be a one-1 this could be a draw I'm just really perplexed let's start with Brighton the fun part if you're like like I look at their lineup and it's quite incredible from Potter to you know derer to the new guy I don't even know his name they just they just play the same expansive beautiful football isn't it I can watch Brighton and just think what they play such great football and so many awesome players and you know on the board likes some Mina matoma you know and and Welbeck funny enough were really really exciting on the ball Shia Pedro funny enough was not he didn't impress me as much as the other three and this is just going to be Brighton you know I wouldn't be surprised if they finish in the top six I wouldn't be surprised if they finish 10th or 11th but it's going to be such a fun ride so I think watching Brighton being a fan I mean I can only say that you know just enjoy it because it's just a fantastic team to watch but and the whole model is incredible how they sell and buy players a to and but with Manchester United once again when they had the same lineup I was in absolute shock because the first thing I thought was okay xery and garnacho will definitely start this game and the players that will be sacrificed are Mason Mount and rashford because rashford like I was said now I could really go into it a bit more a bit like Martinelli he's been carried they're waiting for him to just unlock once again but the top teams at Man United and Arsenal can't afford to do that you know you need to get results you need these players to perform especially in offensive positions when you're relying on them Bruno Fernandez I said to you last week very very strongly that look I know people think it's cute that he's playing his false nine role but he is not that in my opinion he is not that player that he that first came to the Premier League where it was like who is this guy he's unbelievable he likes to be involved in every single element of play which is brilliant as a football fan but obviously as an FPL fan you're hating it Mason Mount I know is is there to press but he's not really man united don't have great pressing formations like Arsenal and Lon Villa they just don't so as I was watching the game I was just thinking yeah Brighton are going to win this comfortably that's all I thought however the moment the players came on in garnacho andz once again you see Manchester United start to create opportunities it's it's verba in what I said last weeko xery drops in really well Dio who is electrifying by the way Dio and then garnacho are starting to act as those inside forwards think of firminho acting with man and Salah but obviously to a different scale and then Manchester United could have won the game they could have absolutely won the game so funny enough when Brighton got the winner it did feel a bit like say the word Smash and grab so but again I keep sitting here every time broken record I've been saying it for the last two years I still do not know what style Manchester United play with I I cannot sit there I can sit there and tell you how Villa play Arsenal play Man City play Liverpool play Tottenham play all pretty much all the teams maybe minus five teams I'll think yep I know what you're trying to do but one of those five teams are Manchester United I I don't understand what he's trying to do he wants Bruno to drop in dio and rashford to be more inside forwards if you like but Russia doesn't do that he plays he he pretty much plays wide now he cut in quite a few times today but you can tell when a player's lacking confidence like Martinelli so he has to in my opinion I I know you want to go more on the game but in my opinion he has to play xeri and garnacho now he just has to because they have no Outlet up there steo and only when xery came on and you got a player in Gara and we agreed last week he's just brilliant to watch cuz he's that old school Winger isn't he he wants to take on his man he wants to take on his man that until that happens if you're looking from an FPL aspect I'm sure you're gonna ask me the question is that I want to go near any of them maybe Dio but I'd rather have Rogers fny mentioned that um so just just quickly col saying here what did you think of Michael Oliver the referee's performance I'm assuming he was the one that was the referee for today's match in man united is that right yeah come I noticed that earlier thanks for the question obviously is sacka gets kicked so much now that it just feels the norm that he gets kicked and nothing happens so there was a couple of times where he D wanted to leave one in him which happens in every game it happened last week against wolves we're so used to it at this point and it's not about protecting your players yeah I don't want to use that old not it's more of if it's a foul it's a foul and when someone is getting kicked at the from the back like greish wood or zaha did especially is you know you you got to blow the whistle and set don't make yourself the S of show because I hate when referees do that they can't help themselves every week a referee wants to become a star just absolute impotence but you know go to G say look you do that again I'm going to have to book you be careful and so in that regards col there were a few times it happened for both teams but I definitely felt like sacka and also uh havocs got hit a few times as well and I felt like look just give a foul have a conversation get the captains around in mcin and erdogan and say hey guys I'm going to start booking your players let's just let's calm down let's just take it easy let's have a good game and unfortunately players were pretty much getting chopped quite a bit now I enjoy Advantage but at times there's no advantage do you know what I mean steo blow the whistle have a conversation I'm not saying wave out the card all the time because it does spoil the game most of the bookings were deserved bookings no doubt about it but a lot of the times those bookings were a bit late including Arsenal players actually you know erard got booked in the 8th minute he should have got booked after an hour for a few of those you know what fernandinho used to do for Man City you know he'd like hold back the player and be like okay I'll take a booking now or I'll I'll I'll break I'll break the rhythm of the game you know you you want the referee there to obviously protect the players but allow the Rhythm to flow and so yeah I'm doing the long one but I definitely felt like the referee let a bit too much go and that's a dangerous game to play isn't it because if you let too much go we're going to start getting those stupid challenges again so you know I hope this is kind of a warning that no one got hurt but someone really could have got hurt actually sta because some of the challenges today on both sides were a little bit Reckless talking of assets you mentioned there so we've just gone through man united we get it the crap matoma ad dingra Mina Welbeck Pedro again like you did with with Aston Villa they have got some okay fixtures coming up Ray so apart from Arsenal which you're not going to be bringing them in for that then they've got ipswitch Nottingham Forest Chelsea Tottenham those next four after Arsenal are very very tasty so if you were to put out of those five three what order what top three of those five would you do you think watching them today do you think is worth having maybe one of them if not two in the team looking forward after the Arsenal game yeah I think mata's top cuz I look at him as nailed and I think we spoke about that last last week that as much as I love the team you know and I think we all love watching them and the thing is every single game you could see them having like six seven changes and nothing changes in regards to the way they play the the chemistry and everything that that really impressive but I remember saying to you the only two players I'll be confident to say are nailed in the team are leis dun Anda so if you said to me what would be my top three assets that I would be happy to bring in Moma by far Top by far it's not even close then after that I'll probably put Xiao Pedro second and as much as I really enjoy MTA ad dingra once again got a return Off the Bench sio and in my opinion he's a better player now I think he's not playing because Arsenal have been linked to him a lot now it isn't a solid kind of you know what we did with Mourinho where we eventually got him it's like yeah I sniffing around ad dingra a lot like every single day it's like yeah they want a Winger and there loads of names being from Sterling to ad dingra to Coman to niik Williams you know there's a lot of players and I think after the transfer window is shut which is Friday is that I think then we could see a dingra coming back in but I'm going to go with matoma and Xiao Pedro and I'm going to leave it at that apologies I'm not going to give a third one because Welbeck you know he's always an injury waiting to happen so I'd never advise that but matoma absolutely because he'll play every single game and Pedro at five and a half maybe you need to correct me is a player of yes he's going to start as that number 10 and maybe as frontman sometimes depending on the opposition that he'd be a player I'd be really excited to have as well however I look at Xiao Pedro always as like a 6040 if he's going to start and not start imagine if he doesn't start against IPS which you're kind of heartbroken but matoma is the player where I'm like yeah yeah I like the sound of Mata well certainly for me with munz he had a couple of opportunities today didn't had seven Shots by the way I want to tell you that funz had seven shots today yeah two On Target yeah he's got for me he's got Lester and then he's out the door and it's then a question of funny enough well Beck or Pedro now Pedro edges it they're both 5.5 okay interesting Pedro edges it because he's on penalties I think Welbeck starts definely all the time because they've got a frontman a focal point to their team it's a bit like I apologize someone said in the chat just now that man united man united need a focal point in their team an actual front man yes sir they can't rely on hland because he's injured all the time who have they got well Xerxes maybe they need someone like funny enough someone like Tony um salanki that's who they need Welbeck but the point being is that certainly munes is going to be gone potentially for Pedro or Welbeck especially with those two those three or four nice fixtures upcoming moving on just quickly with a few comments in the chat I just want to quickly highlight Qtv saying I'm not I'm not trying to brag here I just haven't used no don't worry about it at the end of the day we get a lot of people tuning in and when they say their ranks it just comes across but whatever you know 1500th is absolutely outstanding uh Kyle saying I've got 48 points this week but I still have Salah Captain Isaac and Lewis Hall well that's not too bad I always see it as really that it always evens itself out these points so for instance if on Saturday most people have got I don't know what the average is let's just quickly check for two seconds the average is and of course I'm on the wrong bloody screen surprise surprise the average is 30 what 38 points right okay well in the in the hardcore x Community I would say the average is probably about 58 6 let's just say 60 points average yeah so tomorrow Kyle you know it wouldn't surprise me if Salah pops up with another double digit Hall Isaac pops off with a goal and maybe potentially Hall gets a clean sheet you never know but a lot of these things I've noticed in the world of FPL seem to even themselves out um kelsh saying got 67 points with four left to play very very very good rodri takes and six or seven doesn't he I don't know what that's all about I don't even know um that was when we were when I was talking about those fouls do tactical fouls I think then he commented about rer right TR Rogers saying it's actually 44 the average I mean I I don't know if he's updated on another website on my website here it says 38 but whatever we're not going to [ __ ] split hairs with that so moving on just quickly onto Crystal Palace versus West Ham there's going to be a lot of people with E that are going to be very very very disappointed he didn't come away with the return it ended up being with Bowen and Mr Reeds susek how in Earth he got susek admitted he was just a fifth midfielder he probably hasn't even played him but he's got susek no matter what Bowen and sus with the goals kilman with an assist the bonus points being kilman MRA Panos a former Arsenal player and yeah susek this was a shock result for me Ray I was not expecting more specifically shocked at the fact Crystal Palace didn't score they've now not one in two MH they L both yeah did they lose last week can't brf right yes so they lost two1 to brenford in a local Derby they lose 2-0 to West Ham in a local Derby Crystal Palace F player owners should they be worried or should they just be like no e is going like you said earlier he's goingon to be smashing it soon yeah I mean I've got I've got Henderson and a in my in my game and steo they were kicking West Ham's ass until West Ham got the goal like they were you know knocking at the door hitting the bar lots of kind of you know those cut backs where it's just missing the post or just missing a player like Crystal Palace will very impressive everything we expect him to be the way glasa has him playing I'm so impressed admirable and still looking solid at the back and it was a if you were to name an episode It's called smashing crap but the goal itself on such was so messy because I was watching it and I you know I had like three games up at the same time and I was watching I was like oh my God it's going to be a goal because you know where it's just like everyone's kicking it everywhere it's going left right and and I just see such hovering I'm like this is like a goal he'd scored two years ago you know what I mean and he did he swept it in and then after that Palace are pushing up massively and wam could have probably scored four goals actually because obviously Palace are chasing boen amazing on the Counterattack no doubt about it he always has been and took his goal wonderfully but in regards to your Palace assets regarding e I'm not panicking at all because he keeps getting in the position and he's such a good player that eventually something will come off Muno is a very very good offensive player even though he's a Defender people who went for him in in both formats I didn't want double palace defense that's just how I am because you only get 11 players you don't have 15 is that he looks like one of the main guys that they turn to SEO to create something because they they play a 343 ultimately or 352 and Muno and Mitchell are on as the wing backs but Muno is by far the more creative Outlet so you know I would not worry whatsoever and again apart from E who I'd always look to start is you know you can bench these guys would I bring anyone in if you're G to ask me the question which I'm going to predict you probably would no because Chelsea away okay they got Leicester at home brilliant but then Man United at home Everton will sort themselves out by that game definitely iand a new manager or we find out what the hell is happening and then they got Liverpool at home so unless it's E I would not really look to bring in anyone U Mr scruffy miss a lot saying did Mata look any good no in my opinion no there we are simp simple question simple answer I just want to say there's a lot of people watching right now it' be really cool if you all hit the like button only 17 away from 100 likes that'd be great shows that we're doing a good job moving on to said Fulham to leester one again the goal being pretty fortuitous for Leicester because by all accounts Fulham actually performed very very well today agree leester didn't have much of a sniff of the ball goal scores being Smith row aobi with the assist from uh Trail rate on Robinson a brilliant well I say an assist let's be real here he passes a ball to aobi aobi dribbles for about half an hour and then he puts the ball in the back of the net but that's what they're there to do he gets the assist bonus points being Smith Obi Robinson of course it was Lester's fast who I believe Ash had plane today I'm pretty certain no way I'm I'm sure they said on stream setion that because of the amount of money that he's put into the of course he's got Salen Holland I remember yeah he had yeah and then new player buan Bu deare from from Brighton him getting the assist I seen a for Leicester and I I'd love to know the reason as to why he's not given an opportunity the player I kept banging on about in every single video I was doing and MAV Didi one of the championship players of the season has not had a sniff he's made a couple I don't even know if he came on as a substitute today but he certainly did in the first game against Tottenham I'm sorry to say this but what a flop that's been so far I mean deadora Reed seems to have come in and taken his spot yeah if you're sorry just just to finish if you want MAV Diddy who performed so well for them in the championship last season you must be thinking great we've got this new manager and I can't even get into the bloody team yes steo yeah apologies butting in but yeah they got buan not on loan from Brighton they're playing him doov re they got from Fulham playing him and then I looked at the bench Jordan aou Oliver skip like these are players that they basically in the summer just pinched almost said yeah you've played in the Premier League do something for us that's literally what it feels like so when they all came in today it felt like you know if you're playing FIFA Ultimate Team and you need to build up chemistry these guys had no chemistry whatsoever they got pumble to1 I I'll be honest with you they played so poorly they they were but I'm G to give Fulham more credit I thought Fulham were excellent today uh quite rightly as he said but you said it a lot last season about burn you know that you you're not using the same players that got you up and then you know you're are you trying to use the same style and everything like that and Lester are doing exactly the same now granted I didn't watch any championship football last season but they're coming in and you're trying to put all these players on there to try and find out a way to play and they can't because vardy doesn't hasn't played with these players either isn't it so he doesn't know when to you know stand on the shoulder when to drop in and when he drops in will those Wingers run for him they're not and he's you know he's 37 now you know so he really has to save that energy of course so yeah if I'm looking like you said if I'm looking at M if I'm m d I'm like this is bollocks like these guys are just coming and just basically taking my shirt and they're they're doing nothing that's the thing so yeah agree with you I mean in regards to Fulham I thought they were very very good they could have got four or five goals honestly munis is going to do something SEO but it might be a bit like Darwin it would be in gameweek 27 where no one owns him but munis should have got a couple of goals today there were some good opportunities there so yeah I like your idea of keeping him for one week and then let's see what happens yeah your summarization there pretty much was my thinking regarding munz I'm just having this feeling that he will potentially finally get that goal that he potentially may have deserved um this particular week he's up against a Leicester team who are unfortunately giving away like you just stated a lot of chances and it's looking likely that Fulham could potentially take advantage of um leicester's terrible terrible um form as it stands right now and like you quite rightly say comparing it to Burnley last year like you quite rightly made the point change all the players around it's going to cost you it's going to cost you dearly and unfortunately it looks like that's what's be happening with Leicester moving on to the game which everybody was looking forward to so to speak is Man City versus ipswitch started off in very peculiar circumstances in the sense of some blo called shim modix actually scored for ipswitch Johnson I mean I it's a miracle this 4 million player who didn't start last week he then started in a front three or more specifically a three behind schox had an assist a very fortuitous one I don't know have you seen the goal by the en chant it seemed to have taken about half an hour to roll into the back of the Nets and then within about three minutes City then are then winning 3-1 it ends up being I'll be one minute keep going yeah it ended up with Han getting a hatrick as everybody will know de bruyne with with a goal Savio with two assists de bruyne with another assist the the bonus points being halan de bruyne Savio this game barring the one goal wh switch scored went exactly as we all predicted I've seen the highlights hanen could have got at least another goal and assist I've got a my one of my closest friends team up on screen at the moment who did triple Captain howand it's Dale I'm I'm still above him the Dale's got Quanza Trent and J well differentials on me K Quanza Trent and that's it on me but what the worrying thing for Dale is and it's a bit annoying from my point of view is that and I'm going to assume K Quanza starts tomorrow I personally think Quanza does start tomorrow based on absolutely nothing other than what we me and Jason discussed the other day with Ash regarding the fact that look why is slot just going to remove from the team what kind of message does to send out but look at Dale's bench Pedro and Robinson right there and from my point of view if if I'm in Dale shoes right here it's do I play double Liverpool defense or do I play the gamble in just putting Robinson ahead of Quant who's got the easier fixture well I think it's Robinson ahead of brenford now for all I know K Quanza if he plays as animations who unfortunately revealed fake news on fbl juice I heard that animations but Don juby saying kza picked up a knock in training and he might not play funny that funny how he's picked up an injury after being ousted and being told that he wasn't good enough blah blah blah blah all this nonsense funny that funny how he's got an injury and now all of a sudden he probably won't be starting for got dead leg yeah exactly yeah yeah so the Dale's going to be very for fortunate to be getting Robinson on the pitch for him but that triple captaincy it's what dreams are made of Ray when you use the triple Captain chip on a single game with because I know there's going to be fewer ones this season and it actually pays off and to be honest as I just mentioned just now it could have been a lot bigger and a lot more yes 100% so I was heing everything while I was doing something and uh basically it it was exactly how we played it exactly how we thought it would play out so I predicted 4-0 and quite frankly is the moment they scored I was like like it's probably bad for you I switch and then the next 15 minutes were really strange because if switch was just kind of giving them the opportunities and the goals and then in the second half I kind of had it on as one of the three matches I was watching but I wasn't really watching it it was just on and it was just an exhibition game wasn't it they could have made it six they could have made it seven they could have kept it 31 it could have been kept 2-1 and they'll have 92% possession but in regards to the triple Captain because a couple of people did ask me from the community and they said Ray if you still playing would you triple Captain High I said absolutely and they said why and I said it's the first home game you know everyone's fresh there's no distraction you know they're not going to do replays this season with the FA Cup that the likelihood of double game weeks are so low now that you know I think this is a fixure where he'll definitely get two goals and him getting a hat-trick is yeah you're right it is what dreams are made of but I wasn't surprised he got the hatrick person no and I'm as they mentioned on the commentary this is a tough place to come anyway it's so patronizing and for the manager to get anything out of the game it's just a a miracle ridiculous to be honest with you look that goal came from absolutely out of nowhere you you you get on City quite early and and if you score it's down to you how you approach the game after with a 99 times out 100 everybody just sits back whereas someone like Liverpool Tottenham are like no we're going to get the second goal we're going to get the third goal whatever and the fact that they conceded so quickly I mean I put out the joke on X about Les Denis and Extras and the whole thing of what is the point what is the point you know you score against dip switch and then it's sorry you score against Man City and then within a minute you you you already conceded a penalty just like it just reminded me of Burnley Ray from the past under sha D where it's bloody hell we're actually holding on oh we've conceded after 3 minutes and we looked all right for the first three minutes at the end of the I I feel to be honest more sorry for the people that brought in a different Man City option so I believe your mate Tom he brought in foden for H foden for somebody I can't remember who obviously foden he wasn't even in the squad uh dread if he's still watching he brought in Bernardo Silva nothing there were some people that bought in doku nothing now me and Jason made the point Jason said if I was the triple Captain but it' be Kevin De bruyne over hland in this fixture I mean yeah Kevin De bruyne came through with the gold C yep two bonus points you then had this svino whatever his bloody name is on the right hand side that b accounts is doing extremely well I think he's the same price as Bob 5 million I believe he's the same price as Bob at 5 million and I just think it's just there's that the word that's used a lot in FBO I'm sure it's the same in any bloody fantasy football game is it's variables and unfortunately for a lot of the people that brought in someone different or an additional City asset even Rico Lewis who absolutely how he walloped the crossbar and I believe howand would have got the assist for that Rico Lewis attempt because he just slightly touched it with a with a back of his toenail but certainly with the likes of likes of doku silver kovic vardal for the main three up front pretty much to to just come through the only points and then he's 6.5 this savier it must be quite a bit annoying and a bit frustrating yeah because I could understand the the attraction to say okay I'm going to buy player and I don't want to break the bank and hopefully you know he'll just go ham as we expect Man City to score a minimum of four goals which I did and and which many people did so and you're thinking Bernardo Silva yep he loves games like this he'll chip in with one or two here there and assist okay foden is a premium well just under a premium so that was just unlucky because that kind of came out of nowhere but you can definitely feel like you've been unlucky in regards to getting these players but I always looked at it and thought yeah you get him as an addition for harand rather than trying to get Bernardo and hopefully he'll get a goal or assist to to not match harand but at least I'll get something out of the game maybe that's the best way I I should be expressing myself so I can definitely feel like they've been hard done by in regards to some of the players you're saying now in a very much higher level it's it's like with Brighton you know who who do you pick so KD B I have no doubt will start loads of games but he can't start that many games now he's getting older now and obviously you know they got to look after him because he was injured a lot last season he missed a good I think half of the Premier League games foden will absolutely play every single game once he's back now the likes of Savio I absolutely agree wonderful wonderful player with end product which doku doesn't have you know he he he's actually got that end product to him he's putting the ball in the great areas Goku is one of the finest dribblers I may have ever seen in the Premier League and that's big because obviously I've been watching it since his Inception in 92 I believe but you know the likes of greish is starting to get games now steo and again opposition dependent Bernardo pretty much starts every game it will either be in the middle of the park or it'll be on the right where he'll cut in from the right so you know if you're looking to bring in any assets I know it's exciting to look at Savio and maybe even Goku and Bernardo and everyone I'm just like look keep it clean get Harland maybe a gardio you know if you can fit in kdb incredible how much is kdb by the way is he the same price as Bruno or more expensive foden he 9.5 no kdb yeah he's the same as foden 9.5 Sor apologies and uh Bruno's 8.5 that's correct yeah yeah so even then if you say who would you pick R I'll probably say voden even though he didn't play this game which is weird of me to say but I'll just say harem gardio happy with those two for the coming weeks that's what I feel your thoughts no I I completely agree I think that for me from Man City we don't need to name the main options here but it's pretty much viio hland and if you want a third one in my opinion as it stands right now is Kevin De bruyne he's looked really really sharp he looked really good for the game against Chelsea he looked really good today I think he's on fire at the moment I think that if anybody really wants a nice little differential he de bruyer is a is a really really really good shout col saying here Ash actually left Quan on the pitch he put Barker's second sub and fast's third sub so he'll be praying that Quant doesn't make a miraculous appearance animation saying the goal whips score was absolute garbage but a nice comment for you Ray here I just want to say from Adam he says here I just want to say you two are absolutely brilliant together chat and FPL the chemistry is clearly brilliant and you're an amazing addition to the fbl thanks a million to be completely Frank there was only two names which I spoke about in a moderator meeting who I will happily do this Saturday night reaction with because I know I've got chemistry with well actually there's three names uh one of them was Dan but he will never do it the other person will renamed nameless because I don't want to embarrass them on air just in case they listen but I love them to bits but I know for fact that they can't commit to Saturdays but the one that I suggest immediately was Ry um I've met way we I've met Ray and we had a great time chatting for what was it four and a half hours in a pub just chatting absolute twaddle and I could tell immediate like he's been on the stream before regarding Discord I've really enjoyed speaking football with him he reminds me a lot in fact Ray I've told you this before Ray's just Dan basically and I'm glad that I've made a friend out of Ray and I thought moving forward because I want to do these Saturday night reactions but with somebody Ry was just the number one choice essentially and uh yeah I'm I'm glad that Ry accepted mine and Jason's invitation any quick words Ray before we move on no I mean first of all thank you so much for the feedback and to be honest with you SAA and I are friends very very happy to say we're friends for the last six months we do voice notes daily and know a lot about each other which is great and I think just meeting in Victoria when we did was almost kind of like the yeah we can do something and you know you are very kind enough to understand that if I cannot make which may happen you know you know wife and kids and stuff like that I would let you know way beforehand out of respect to you and obviously respect to that hopefully you know the dynamic doesn't change in any way whatsoever but it's quite funny actually joining and we're talking FPL but it's still very pertinent to me if that makes sense because I'm just giving opinions on players and how it will work in FPL and no no I I appreciate that and as dread says oh friend no no no dread would say it like ow friend oh my God dread Julian is that you that would be Julian there Ray um I'll deliberately read this message out in the sty of dread he uh he Juno saying here maybe I'll maybe I'll sell Palmer for Kevin De bruyne you know what Juno sounds like a very good plan and close Oscar here saying what do we think of vaner then I'll just give an immediate reaction to that he plays for Tottenham he's going to concede a lot of goals the the assist was extremely fortuitous if if I was going to choose anybody from the back four of Tottenham I'm stating the obvious it's poro then new doggy then Romero and then whoever the next one is which is going to be vaner um moving on to the final game Russ Morgan is saying I'm feeling a bromance so absolutely like I said when you have a camaraderie with somebody it's always chemistry when you are on a podcast or a TV show whatever it is it's like the same with as I always say with FPL juice there are certain guests that juice get on where it's like you could listen to them for literally hours because the four of them have such a spark and a chemistry together so but yeah moving on to the the the final one to talk about which is Southampton oh no I think we cover Spurs I can't remember um we didn't cover spurs in regards to the fixture itself no right so Seth Hampton Notting for us I'll be honest with you Ray I want to gloss over this because despite the fact that although Dan I can already hear Dan go no people want to hear about your opinion about Southampton and an Forest when it was summed up by the Moose on TSW like I said earlier where essentially he said that sth could be playing until their next home game which isn't for at least another four weeks and they still wouldn't score that's how bad they were this for me Ray truth be told is a fixture Southampton should be targeting for a minimum of a draw and that's being pessimistic they should be targeting this fixture as a win this game is pretty much almost perfect setup for a Nuno uh type um where he will just do what an Aston Villa just allow Southampton to come at them and hit them on the bre Break by all accounts it wasn't that that at all Nottingham Forest were all over Southampton they absolutely dominated the game how they only scored one is beyond me that player of course was the one player on the pitch that you don't want well from an FPL point of view the one player on the pitch you don't want scoring is Gibbs white Jason owns Gibbs white surprise surprise the bonus being Ana Gibbs white for three Melo and Nico Williams for one nothingham forest and Assets in the game a lot of people have gone with a minimum of maybe one Defender Chris Wood I think a lot of people will be disappointed that Chris Wood didn't get on the score sheet at some point today I don't know how involved he was sthampton on the other hand I think their a lot of their games are going to be quite low scoring by all accounts they are a high possession based team they like to pass it around a lot it just sounds like the end product just isn't there Notting Forest came there to win they did win by 1 nil it should have been three anything to note on this match Ray no I Echo everything you you said I completely agree in both aspects regarding both teams I mean when I may do a draft in FPL a proper draft I had I had a not Forest defender in there because you know nuno's gotten playing Nuno football now the one we remember at wolves isn't it the ones that are difficult to score against and on the counter you know it used to be Adat tror gimenez and jotter and it here they got Gibbs white Hudson Ado and wood but eventually on one year as I said to you last week I think a one year will eventually get him because he's better player in my opinion I don't even think it's just my opinion I think he's a better player they just want his Fitness up but if you said to me would you bring in an asset absolutely I'd say bring in a Defender I'll go with Murillo over Ana because Murillo is nailed I don't know if he's a captain but he's nailed in the team and and Gibbs white because he's the main man and I think he's a penalty taker I think he's a penalty taker so those would be the two assets and again lovely fixtures isn't it overall I mean in their next five they've got Wolves At Home Brighton away Fulham at home three good fixtures okay against Liverpool bench your assets even if you got Gibbs right I'd bench him and against Chelsea they're just a you don't know what they are at the moment and then Palace and leester and Keo is he going to start from him he joined Forest yet no and I'm so happy you've said that but it's imminent and inevitable and therefore if they're getting ktia 100% he's a front man for them thank you for saying that interesting interesting uh Oscar saying his son Smith row Kevin De bruers J and Gibs white a decent Midfield it's it's a it's an excellent Midfield that is there um Francis Logan is happy with the Millo bonus we've got a lot of chat between dread podner and the various members of Hangouts which is always good to see CLA saying that because someone here says regarding is are we all missing that's it chuku saying are we all missing are we all ignoring Nicholas Jackson for his run of fixtures and CLA just summing out perfectly Jackson is a void forever completely agree with that Miss Jack y Russ Russ saying I'm worried about Chris Wood I really wouldn't be worried about chriswood just yet he's still gonna be starting every single match until Nuno decides that his form just isn't good enough and of course animations there just advertising Discord and yeah if you want to continue just chatting f with lighthearted light minded people and just chatting whatever the Discord is available and you can get into the Hangouts and talk with the people like Dread podner Buffy fireo etc etc there always a good I add to that I wasn't able to last time about the Discord about what it's done for me would you mind you said let me just quickly finish so sure sorry with Discord as well you're able to join us for Sunday surgery which will be happening tomorrow evening which enables you to join myself and Jason talking to us about your teams now Ray here actually gave me an idea of how we're going to do it a bit differently tomorrow so stay tuned for that yeah Ray go for Discord apologies though yeah yeah I don't I interrupting I did there um personally I can only say just myself is that Discord is brilliant because I don't really go on obviously because I don't like Discord itself the way it's laid out however I do love the community aspect and I do love all the different channels depending on what we're talking about sometimes even live matches and stuff like that where I'm sure some of the guys watch together so it's actually built a fantastic Community within itself in Elite FPL where Jason Dan and steo aren't even with all due respect needed for the machine to keep moving so even if you don't want to join in to be a patreon for example which would be ridiculous because you should but actually go on to Discord join in and there's some fantastic members there like animations like Dread like other individuals in there as well so yeah yeah I'm I'm I'm basically just beating the drum but yes Evo the Discord been brilliant and ultimately it's how I met you guys so yeah absolutely Scotland vest saying I've missed the stream just watch on the replay simple Scot investor Dan's actually here Dan what on Earth are you doing here you're supposed to be doing not the match of the day challenge you do the match of the day challenge on the Sunday what you doing it mate um with so many Strikers seemly not getting many points in their matches at their cost it's time to transition to a 352 I think I think still hold on to your three Strikers as it stands right now although CLA making a point that wood today was absolutely Anonymous in their match against I've completely forgot to South Hampton moving on to Dan's favorite team which is Spurs oh wait a minute Dan um look away now Dan they ended up winning 4-0 we did mention it earlier it could have ended up it should have ended up being maybe five six seven if sank had played God knows what the score could have been I think I mean you had sank in Telegraph you had to transfer him out I believe for a man city asset is that what you doing yeah gardiola is really boring I didn't want to do it but you know I in any FPL game in any Fantasy game I don't want to be thinking oh I hope he plays I hope he plays I hope he's back and then miss out on potential points and so yeah took him out and I I could see Tottenham absolutely brutalizing them in this game because of everything you know Spurs obviously first home game of the season they want to put on the show you know Andes at least at times gotten playing a lot more like how he wants them to play and Everton are just an absolute effing mess aren't they they're just an absolute mess and yes I caught the highlights I didn't actually watch the game but I caught the highlights I was like how was it only 4-0 yeah like I said Sun's second goal in my opinion brilliantly taken but very fortuitous pford could have potentially done something a lot better his first goal was just a pitford mistake it could happen to anybody but in this case it happens to pitford a basuma an absolute Wonder strike of course it was inevitable he was going to score after being banned for the first game Romero a typical Center back goal we've got assist from koseski Madison vanen vanen again very fortuitous assist but whatever they're given the bonus points going three to Sun Romero to basuma with with the one you mentioned Everton there are they they they've lost three- nil last week to Brighton lost 4-0 today to Tottenham next week it's still not looking any better they are at home to Bournemouth done no n I want to go back to Tottenham because I can't be bother to talk about Everton because no one cares about Everton they just care about to yeah Mark Everton yeah Spurs any salanki owners slash sellers they're going to be so gutted that everon that were there for the Tak and then he's now injured for potentially not just a Gaye game but also next week against Newcastle yes absolutely I mean about San we were just absolutely yeah we were screwed in that part in regards to him being out because we could everyone not only salanki owners could foresee that this is a game where he could go absolutely ham it was all set up for him wasn't it those positions even the positions where no one was there because sun's not a striker you know he's an incredible left Winger world class he's incredible I think sun is absolutely amazing player but salanki with his positioning would have just got a bag full definitely a brace I could see so selling him in my opinion is absolutely the right decision because I don't think he'll be back for the Newcastle game and you'd probably hesitate to start him in that game anyway and then of course after the international break home to Arsenal we're defensively the best team in the league so you know selling him was the right thing to do but we probably bought him in even in my game I probably bought him in for those first two fixtures and feel cheated from the fact that against Leicester he had a couple of opportunities and obviously he wasn't here but yeah steo but to be honest with you if if I don't know who I'd want to bring in from there I mean Pedro porro of course I can understand but again you were targeting to those first two games isn't it way to Newcastle home to Arsenal you know I I want my Defender to defend first if that makes sense and in those two games i' I'd be surprised if Tottenham don't concede at least three goals in total from those two games what what are your thoughts yeah we at Newcastle like I said I think we potentially depending on how Newcastle perform tomorrow and Dan if you are still listening you know you are going to be not necessarily there but you are in the hometown of Bournemouth I'm expecting Newcastle to do a demolition job on Bournemouth I'm expected it to be 3-1 so let's just say that happens or Newcastle win convincingly even if it's 2-0 but they look like they're they're a threat they've then got ton home which like I said that could be a high-scoring game and and the good news is Ray is that it's at a 130 kickoff and I'm pretty certain last year I could I could check but I'll be all day looking for it I'm pretty certain last time it was a 130 kickoff between Newcastle and Tottenham it was quite high scoring I could be wrong but I'm certain that's the case in fact Dan you'll remember then they're at Arsenal at home I think most people in FPL have got poro all people that you know are within the community gone with Pororo look at the moment as it stands with my game week two three team I've actually got poro on the bench I'm pretty certain I've got poro on the bench let me just quickly check for a split second here and the answer is on my bus team the answer is I'm pretty certain it's yes and the answer is no um I thought I had him on the bench world class content oh that's right that's actually correct I'm actually seriously thinking of playing Johnson ahead of poro but it's unlikely because basically because Johnson played today he's got Fulham at home I may play Johnson over Robinson but it's going to be a toss of a coin really interesting I always say this line about not benching pre team Defenders and I'm probably still going to play him but as it stands right the second R I've got Isaac as Captain I've got Isaac as Captain against Tottenham as it stands right this second so that's how confident I am in Newcastle but if tomorrow Newcastle perform flat and it ends up being one nil boring Gordon does nothing in the game it ends up being I don't know Harvey Barnes scoring with a I don't know whatever bloody random Newcastle player assisting at this point I'm like on a minute here I think I've absolutely um gone the wrong way with Newcastle but we will find out tomorrow really uh but Tottenham assets if you own you own I wouldn't be bringing any in yeah I would be I mean we've got a comment here says son two goals in an easy route think he would be contributing as main as a main threat over the next few weeks no I'm still not have again I didn't watch the game but he was rubbish against Leicester absolutely the rubbish and then today two very very very fortuitous goals and I was listening to the radio and the only players that seem to be getting the names mentioned were koseski and Madison yep so I just think that look at the end of the day if you've got Sun well done if you don't own him seriously do not worry about I'd rather in all seriousness I'd rather own sacka I'd rather own Kevin De bruyne it really doesn't matter I wouldn't be owning I wouldn't be wanting to bring him in shall we say Ray I I think that's pretty much the end of this stream and we've spoken for nearly two hours we're only supposed to be going for about an hour um any final thoughts about today's matches before we clear off yeah I mean regarding Spurs if you're looking at assets I mean if you know we I always had porro in a draft that I'd make you know either for myself or or friends family when they're like can you give me a draft that you'd make I always had porro in there because you play them for the first two then you bench them for these two then you play them again isn't it they they're great fixtures in regards to offensive and even potentially defensive opportunities for Spurs so a bit like yourself I wouldn't bring anyone in whatsoever so but in regards to today's matches is again a bit like last week no shocks no shocks is it really every single game I'm kind of like yeah I could have seen that in fact the biggest shock for me steo is West Ham beating Palace I genuinely thought Crystal Palace were gonna win this game and even when I was watching it as well I thought they were going to win but otherwise I think more the fact that ended 2 nil ended 2-1 in fact as I mentioned to Jason and Ash the other day in the last six fixtures prior to today there was 28 goals scored between these two I think today was the first time there's been a clean sheet now in the last seven and ending 2-n so I think the Crystal Palace we've already discussed it but I think they're going to feel a grief that they didn't come away with anything today I completely agree with you the shock result being yeah I agree with you being being West Ham maybe at a push and at a push Southampton losing 1 nil if they lost 2-1 at least they've given it a go they've got a goal in it the fact they lost one nil and they weren't in the game at all that's very very worrying for Southampton fans Fair brilliant um my team up on screen is next week's team I just wanted to quickly show it as as I said I've got Isaac as my bus Captain as it stands right this second because I am quite confident that could be high scoring but it's all going to change by next week because obviously we'll have seen Newcastle tomorrow um is then a case of do I play John Johnson at home to Fulham or Robinson away to IP switch as it stands right now I'm quite potentially the way Johnson was positioned today I may put it on John I may put Johnson in there to be honest with you um other than that it's been a brilliant day for a lot of us myself and Jason are going to be going live tomorrow evening for Sunday surgery so you can join us again uh for for more absolute twaddle um other than that it's been a great stream with Ry you can follow us on xpl if you want to follow us

sounds about right feel like home we like to push the boundaries of of like getting things done and we we tonight we uh we certainly um had some problems and and I can I can only apologize really on my behalf Ash because I've never had that issue happen before with three people so you know I I didn't see it happening but uh yeah see still sto's fault um but hello everyone in the chat sometimes I get it um I you don't get paid you know maybe maybe there could be something of a a content creator fund that we could enter Jason like buy me a coffee or a patreon you mean um but in all Ser all Ser help that issue yeah yeah yeah if we if we raise I know x amount we promise to be on time like uh in all in all seriousness um we're here to talk FPL um we will get into it um it's a Wednesday night and the Wednesday nights are going to be our new Thursday nights or new Friday nights I should say um because it's what suits us the best there has been some news in the FPL world that we'll talk about and certainly um there's also been a reveal that one of us has stated that they're going to be hitting a certain button at and I only just found out about that before the stream and I I I want to know if it's true or whether it's you know just clickbait but uh who is it who's going to be hitting a certain button it's not me it's it's not me it's it's well I guess then by process of elimination must be me see we didn't get him on Just for his looks is um s right so what so so you've hit the what what button have you hit uh I've hit the triple the triple Captain mate I'm trip I'm taking I'm taking it's yeah it's going to be on Harland so is are you are you 100% going to do this 100 100% you're not even like you're not even worried my mind is done doing if har gets injured steo what's your thoughts on it obviously uh you know it's a very very good fixture isn't it very enticing Harland obviously getting I I don't know how many touches he but I think he only had three passes last game does the fact that he doesn't get involved in the match in in the typical City match worry you or do you think that's not what he's there for he's not there to get involved he's there to be on the end of a ball you've just answered your own point I I said on patreon three three by the way that John Harris stated that he's going to be using his triple captaincy on haland I implore him to use it I want him to use it and Ash is using his triple captaincy he's going to be doing it I think it's a great fixture and this is a man who potentially can get a hattick in the first half and if that is or at least a minimum of a double digit return I think that anybody listening into this that has the konas to hit that triple captaincy do it if you seriously think this is the best time to use a triple captaincy chip on one of the best strikers in the world just do it and I want Ash to do it I know he will be be going through with it and I'm hoping John Harris and others follow suit if Ash's team is now on the screen by the way Ash's team is now on the screen um it switch at home it's got all the Hallmarks of a drubbing in my opinion I think 40 we we'll get to predictions at some point um I mean this this this is like if it goes for you if he if he does Hall then it's the right time of the season to Come Away with a triple captaincy success you're because it's gameweek two you're going to be in the top 1% of the game easily if if he comes through um I mean I mean where are you at the moment um I know we don't we don't really put too much on it at the moment in where overall ranking but where are you at the moment Ash in the rankings I'm like I'm like 700 700k this decision this decision is it just makes perfect sense like we've in in previous Seasons we've all waited for double game weeks to hit our triple captain and been largely unsuccessful I can't even remember the last time I got a really good triple captain on a game week I just can't remember it's probably like probably this season they got a top 10K um oh yeah so this is um it's a really easy one for me because it's the best team in the world yeah the best striker in the world playing a newly promoted side who just lost a bunch of players and they' just basically got rag tag team they've just managed to sign whoever they can sign they've made some good signings but they're not a team yet I definitely think home they're going to be at home to this team like I'd be if it's not at least five are be gutted there should be five goals it should be five nil all day long and Holland should be getting a hat-trick and if the triple Captain comes off I'm in a great position and also because the um there's the the FA Cup replays are gone right there's less chance of there being more doubles at the end of the season so we could be I could choose not to play the triple captain now wait for a double later on in the season and there might not be an appealing double then because they're only going to have one maybe two double game weeks where it's before it might have been three or four to pick from so for me it just makes perfect sense and especially at this time like Mo like the amount of people who don't have Harland now that's only going to go that's only going to change there's only going to be more people getting Harland in so I'm going to do it now while less people have him so that it the percent like the effect of it is felt more strongly so yeah I I I made my decision on this probably a couple of days ago and um I'm happy with it I'm not going to turn back I don't think there's anyone that could stand there with a serious face and say it's a it's a mistake to use your super captain in this fixture albe it is a single game week and a lot of people do put so much on double gameweek trible captains however it's definitely got one of the Hallmarks of being a gameweek where if you don't triple captain and he goes off on one everyone will be looking back in hindsight going it was the obvious week to do it like I can I can hear it now I can hear people saying now it was the obvious fixture to do it why didn't you do it you said you yeah and I think people that aren't going to do it are just hung up on the fact that it's a single game week I think that's probably the the only reason I can see why people aren't going to do it because the fixtures there you've just said it yourself um and and like the people in the chat saying you know I you know Edgeworth I've trible captained in the last two years and a single game week and it's come through for me 45 points both times you know so it's it can massively pay off at the right time on a single game week and like you mentioned a minute ago Ash how many times have we seen it over the years where everyone's followed the crowd they've waited for a double game week fixture congestion triple Captain boom fail fail so so yeah I I I actually think that I think to be honest with you the main I think the main thing that people are are are is holding people back is a single game week and I think it's stupid and I think to be honest it on paper it's it's it makes sense it really does make sense it's gameweek two at the end of the day last season where where harand scored um did he score three or four in a game it was four and an assist four and an assist right yeah and people triple CED in there and people triple CED him in a double game week where he didn't where I think he got maybe one goal in two games or whatever it was in fact sorry just to just to interject it was actually a hattick and an assist and it was versus Chelsea yeah last year you just got to catch him on the right day and like I'm playing the fixtures and I'm playing I'm playing this game with fun not playing it cautiously anymore not doing that whole thing where I'm waiting till a double game happen I'm just going to play the fixtures and whilst like I say whilst no not as many people have got him it's the ideal chance to just make use of having Holland in your team because if he goes off like I'll be gutted if I didn't do this and he went off and scored two three four goals and I didn't triple Captain it I'll be gutted myself we'll get we'll get some balance in this conversation and it not go right we'll get some Ballance in this conversation because I've said that I think it's a really good idea but I'm also looking at comments and Glenn's brought up a really good comment he's saying that while I agree triple Captain is a good shout Devil's Advocate foden not up to speed right now no rodri in the team no greish who gets lots of assists for for Harland historically and Al res has left so um obviously Kevin bruyer is is there um does that play into you think you mentioned a minute ago you're not you're not even in the slightest doubt in your decision now you're going to go through with it but does he make good points there Glenn um I mean rodri yeah is a bit of a loss but he wasn't a loss when they went away and and convincingly beat Chelsea last week um I think kovic played well if anything he was probably one of the star players I think he adapted to that role really really well um the the the the the positive thing about man city is they've got strength and depth regardless of who's playing or not playing you got svino on the right hopefully he's fit he was a real problem a real problem for Chelsea um so no foden but they might have him foden foden can do what foden does even if he's on the bench he can come on and make an impact kdb's had pretty much a whole summer because Belgium went out of the euro early so he's up he's fit um I don't think Gund one's back but it looks like he's going to be coming back probably maybe this fixture comes a bit too early for him but dku man dku is an absolute Live Wire they're gonna struggle with him big time so I'm not concerned about who they don't have I'm quite happy with who they do have and on their day I think City will roll over anyone let alone a newly promoted side so and I don't care how many touches hardland gets as long as the touches he does get are the ones that go in the net that's all I care about no precisely I completely agree with that opinion and so you're predicting what's your score line you just a general prediction for them 5 n five five n five so you're expecting a a minimum of a d at least obviously a double digit return I get that but certainly a minimum what would okay what would your realistic expectations from haland be realistic five minimum two goals two two or two two attacking returns goal and assist or two goals right no two goals two goals two goals minimum okay W no I I do enjoy the confidence and in fact I love the confidence and certainly I mention a lot throughout the season that for instance it was actually last year when I recommended captaining triple Captain hen versus Fulham at home I think in the end he got a goal and an assist I think someone in our Discord did actually go through with my advice and did it and they were relatively happy they wish he got more but certainly this is as you just said Ash this is a prime fixture to be jumping on for the Triple captaincy and to be completely Frank with my dilemma at the moment it's do I stick with the team that I've got which I chose for pretty much two game weeks and then kind of re-evaluate some of the decisions or do I do a minus four for son and anduku out for foden and e but people said on the patreon steo son is at home to Everton just wait just wait and see what he does just leave the captaincy on hand that's fine see what happens and and you're away and it will be a case of for argument sake if I did do that minus four and then Sun comes through with a double digit Hall and foden makes a sub appearance gets an assist I'm there with complete egg on my face so I'm trying my hardest not to do any moves and get rid of four points when I've said all along that I want to stick with a S A Simple Plan don't get me wrong coming away from gameweek one there were some players which I was pretty disappointed with Smith row being one of them munz being another but they were playing man united away what was I expecting in fact you you at Fantasy Football Fest what were people's opinions of Fulham coming away from that that game afterwards um I I think people were a little bit I think people were expecting more from Fulham um I don't think Smith row had the impact lot people thought they would but you have to remember that they were playing away Smith R is his what first competitive start for the Side Y um and man you uh have got some good players like we we we talk and we joke and we laugh about how Manu maybe have fallen off and you know they're not such a good team anymore but they have some real quality in there in their in their team and and on another day Bruno puts them two nil up um they did well to hang in there I thought and Manu did well to to Nick it at the end but I I I wouldn't be downhearted about Smith row and F's performance like you say it was a away um but they've just signed Yim Anderson they do have that's happened has it yeah that's all going through so they've managed to sign the right side of Center half now um their team looks like pretty pretty decent like throughout the squad they've got some really good players um so and I think Smith R was playing quite very high up he was playing a proper number 10 well it it for me he from watching the game he seemed like a player which had a lot of ability on the ball some of the passes and the touches that he had was in my opinion way above a lot of the fulam players on the team it was like you could tell he'd gone from a premium team in Arsenal to a a me a medior well like a mid-table team in Fulham yeah and it felt that he was bit like with Messi he was dropping deep just to get the bloody ball so he could get the ball moving forward a lot more quicker some of the passes that he was making was just absolutely ridiculous it's just a shame that Fulham were sitting quite deep and I think that if they were playing Leicester in the first game rather than man united I think we probably would have seen a slightly different type of attack from Fulham and obviously you've got Smith row and your team for the fix because it makes sense with Rogers home to Arsenal and the other two being baram and Faz and certainly I would think that against Leicester who performed okay against Tottenham but really they should have been two a minimum of two- nil down at halftime I think Spurs deserve to go into the the second half being two n up but whatever if Fulham take advantage of how poorly Leicester were if leester performed the way they did in the first half against Fulham I think that Fulham May genuinely take advantage and I hope they do so and I'm really hoping that Smith row comes Away With A Min minimum of an attack and return Ash in that game against Leicester yeah yeah me too I think so there's there's not a lot a lot of talk about people jumping off Smith throw yet he's not he's not been given a chance yet to to Really shine so I I think in the next few weeks they've got some good early fixtures for them um I think that'll be enough time to really have a look at him and decide whether or not he's going to be a viable asset for us moving forward um it's just it's just too early to tell with Smith row and at 55 you're not really too fast about waiting a little bit longer than perhaps if you had someone who was a bit more expensive like a son who didn't look fantastic for Tottenham you maybe you might be a bit more inclined to move off him a little bit quicker just because you've got a lot more money tied up on him so yeah I'm quite happy with Smith row at at that price point did you watch the Chelsea man city game uh yeah yeah yeah yeah what did you think of unuku because from my point of view I actually thought he was all right but it was just the rest of the team that were pretty near really it was just disappointing obviously that he came off at the 58th minute well it seems quite it's quite interesting because there's been quite a difference of opinion obviously we did the juice show last night and we had um Daryl Mo and F Ed Craig on I talked about how I thought enu played quite well I thought he was quite Lively on the ball he on another day could have had a couple of chances he was involved in anything that was good for Chelsea moving forward um I would like to see him start more centrally to be honest with you I think he's kind of wasted out on the wing and maybe that's something that's going to change I don't really know because they're just s out Felix um but yeah the the performance from what he the minutes he did play obviously dragged before 60 I thought there was enough from him for me to keep him in my team for another week at least he scored against wolves away last season if I remember rightly that's the next fixture yeah I think he scored I think it was his first goal of the season I think it was a header um all right um so yeah I'm I'm really Keen to see if he can replicate that this this coming week and again it's it's too early to tell like they played the best team in the land at home with a again a rag tag team of newly assem I say newly assembled most of them have already been there for a little for a year or two but people like Lavia coming back into the team and K's like been in and out of the team so it's really difficult to tell but on first glance I think there's enough there for us to to keep him in our teams for at least a short ter yeah you had a poll last night for Mo regarding does he play Smith Rowan and cuckoo and I think 7% said in well I've got the same dilemma and I've got anuku on the bench and that was my original plan if you want to call it that I just think wolves away is actually a pretty difficult fixture at if Chelsea were at home oh I'd be playing inuko because it's away from home I can see that game being quite tight nil nil 1 one one nil either way 21 either way something like that but wolves can't score they're absolutely hopeless in front of goal so it's going to be a lowc scoring game you've got a team who are trying to fit God knows how I mean I even saw last night the video of them all being in the gym and working out and whatnot and I'm thinking is this some kind of AI joke at the moment Jason's been sending me some videos of the capabilities of AI and I'm think AI yeah yeah is this is this video here and it's not it was a real video of the Chelsea first team or whatever training in a gym I'm thinking um what's going on I just want to say a shout out to a few people in the chat we've got some new faces in here as well as some big big names uh that have jumped in tonight probably following Ash as well I got yena yena's here uh and we've got the one and only editor in the chat as well um very well known in the community and he says steo think I think your Discord are right son at home to Everton don't want to hit that out so he agrees with a lot of other people don't make rash decisions patreon Craig it's it's free yeah yeah we might have mentioned that once or twice the patreon is free to check out and listen to steo I'll ask Ash because Ash is the expert if if people are brand new around here Ash and they think the stream is okay what should they do Ash I think would be a really good idea and this is just I'm I'm just freestyling here um I think it'd be good if they just liked it you know like the stream you know the bit that says that there a little logo just click on that bit you can tap it on your phone or you can click it on your mouse and there's a button I think there's a button it says something like uh is it subscribe or something could you not do that in your um website I'm welome to the DJ set of the want a DJ voice hold the man inside make sure you subscribe to The Ting bre show some support show some love to the guys Steve Jason on one night one time one time I think we should make that we should definitely make that the audio clip people unsubscribe we'll make that the audio clip so when people actually subscribe we'll make that play make it play I'm just you're the one and what what should they do on um x j cuz we're live streaming on X what should yeah if you're if you're on X and you're watching on X hello to all of you guys and big shout out to the viewers there if you want to follow us on social media elpl and join our Discord our Discord is free uh and it's a hive of information uh lots of people are now in discords with different FPL discords but certainly one of the original discords lots of members in it's a great great Community to be part of and they do a lot of hangout discussions talking about all things football related and real life um so it's good a good opportunity to meet likeminded FPL managers so even if you're not in a mini league with other Rivals and you're just looking at U you can certainly get into Leagues with people that are similar-minded to you and get to meet some awesome people in the Discord also um but yes a shout out to everyone watching on on uh X which is now which is now called um so yeah I've got on the uh screen so let me just switch over because this is um the points you got um so yeah you again 700k OD you said very good game week one um we'll get on to um we'll get on to predictions in a second but uh no Fires at all in that team really and um like you said I do have fires where's your what's your fire I got I've got fires well Pedro Pedro poru is yellow flagged which is a concern he's fine isn't he is he he's fine what what's has there been any news that's come out say that he's going to potentially miss next game or is it is it a wait and see for it's yeah it's definitely a wait and see but just judging by I watched the game and he was really struggling at the end of that he was stamping on his leg for ages and he didn't look happy and he got taken off and then um I don't know how much you look into these things but there's a like a physiotherapy account that I started following and they were saying oh If he if he has got what they think he's got which is some sort of twisted ankle and that's probably like one to two weeks out so it's just a PL in the back of my mind that there's a good possibility that he might not be fit for the next game but obviously that's hope that he is so that's just one that's sort of on the on the back burner if you like but my my real issue is K Quanza who I've kept and now that he's gone down in price I'm gonna have to keep him now there's no point7 now might as well just keep him and ride out see what happens I don't have much backup on the bench barco's gone and I got Val Faz there who's at home to Fulham and I don't really see me playing him instead of qua so I might as well just risk it I think Daryl made a really interesting point last night and I was just doing the bins and just nodding away and just thinking he's got a point about slot and what kind of message does it send out to not just Quant but anybody where it's just yeah you're not good enough I'm just going to drop you now at least give me another game if he doesn't perform well against brenford in the first half and he's dropped again because he's not doing what slot wants him to do at this point it's yeah Quanza we need to have a conversation here I've asked you to do this you haven't performed to the duties that I've asked you to do this guy here can or whatever his bloody name is he's doing the job that I want him to do you're now going to have to prove yourself in training that you can fit the system I want you to be in he's playing against brenford I'd be shocked if he's just dropped after one bloody game he's been playing in pre-season perfectly fine for Liverpool he's coming to the first game yes okay there's a few people out there that are incredible when it comes to looking at tactics and whatnot and they understand why slot took him off but I think it would be very very harsh to just automatically just drop him from the team and I think that give him one more game at least I think your problem here Ash is that for argument sake pororo's out for argument sake Quant doesn't play youve said you got fast but then you've got Barker who looks like he's probably going where as well he's gone but that's all right I triple Captain Harland that makes he actually gone has he yeah he's gone to I think it's is it s or that's official something like that yeah I think I saw fa Brito Romano tweet it possibly someone in the chat might be able to tell me where is this I mean suggesting for one you're some kind of Spanish football expert but you are very knowledgeable when it comes to football and where I don't get I don't get this kind of treatment on juice I just really kind keep talking like that I was GL to use the c word then but I can't I was going to call your your your juice juice team a bunch of you know what but very accurate but in all seriousness where on Earth has this come from because let's get real here we've had a lot of Brighton fans saying that this guy's the next upcoming left back what not he's probably taking es dup man's plays two two weeks later he's yeah he's gone now gone yeah it's so typical a't it like I don't even know it's not like I even like followed any like big FPL content creators and was like yeah I'm going to do what they say I just I just I just heard that he was good then I checked the preseason friendlies I saw he was playing and then I'd learned that he was on some set pieces and I four M that's an absolute steal like a stupid Yan out like it just made sense right um but yeah it was a bit of a surprise to see hinwood lining up at left back for the away trip to Brighton I thought that's a bit of a strange one was Barco even on the bench I'm not even sure he was on the bench no he wasn't he wasn't in the squad no but yeah apparently I'm just looking at the chat um sevia yeah onlan with option to buy so he's just a non-starter now get out the The only positive from people owning him is that that price will be locked so you won't get the minus point1 on it it's funny you mentioned about not following big FB content creators because your team is for for a Salah haland team it's it's it's very good and the little the little differential the little differentials that you've got here like reyer Mitchell Fernandez both halan Salah you could ARG You could argue potentially Chris Wood unless you names dread FPL or semi casual there's there's some differential picks here that aren't to the normal standard and I suppose for you the fact that you are being potentially swayed by various content creators means that these decisions are literally your own and the fact that you went with Salah Captain as well what was the decision behind that um so I could to that in two parts so I i' I've started actually watching a lot more content obviously being in the space you're kind of drawn to it any anyway I always like to see what's kind of going on I like to see who's like new who's up and coming what's going on catching up with some familiar faces and stuff I just find people's opinions interesting um but I've decided I'm not going to let it sway my decision making this season and this season I wanted to go in with a really considered approach um for me the the the two best players in the league are Holland and seller and that's where I built my team around I thought that's the spine of my team I did want Trent in there but it just didn't it didn't Stack Up it couldn't it couldn't stack up I couldn't make a balanced side with Trent in there as well so that's why I brought in qua see where a lot of people brought in Trent I brought in qua to cover that Def and obviously he's notna get the attacking returns Trent does but he'll cover the clean sheets we hope um and then obviously players like jot I'm like oh jot but jot against Salah Salah the team's kind of still built around Salah still a question mark over J because you know Darwin's still there gakpo still there and that was lingering the back mind I still think J was a great pick but I just wanted to build that team around Harland and Salah so that's what I did and then I tried to just find Value in other positions and I also went with the you'll notice that some some managers have gone with like three Arsenal or three Newcastle or three Liverpool I went with two Liverpool but I Tred to spread out the teams throughout the team so I tried to go for one sort of key player throughout the the most of the top Sid so I've got Pedro por from Spurs I've got um wood from forest who had a good early run of fixtures I got Smith Row from filam got good early fixtures Bruno who's basically the main man at United although I did flirt with rashford and garnacho I really wanted some Manu in there I got laughed about it um particularly for having rashford in my team he almost had he had a stone cold assist if hold on hold on can I can I give you a laugh Ash one of mine Jason's close friends who is genuinely good at FPL can you have a random guess who he captained on Friday evening rashford mhm yeah yeah got missed that chance he got laughed at but he could have yeah he could have easily walked away with an assist but I mean it would have been un fortuitous assist I don't know if it was intention like fully intended to be going to G however it would have been an assist um from my point of view I think I think as a man united fan what do you think of Ash saying that he wanted Fernandez G I mean Fernandez is the safe pick right he's going to get them minutes he going to get all the minutes you're going to get some manag minutes for Garo uh to a lesser extent obviously um rashford's got a point to prove obviously last season he was very much off off the boil um it's it's down to him now to prove all of his hate is wrong and have a good season really um do I think he can turn it around absolutely I do and I think some new faces into the team bit of re revigor into that team and a bit of belief and uh energy I mean I I don't know why I I actually did think casemiro was was all right um and I think that I think that um he's gonna have a great I I I have a feeling Casmir is gonna have a good season it's gonna I'm going to jinx it now I know I am but I think United I think United's mindset might be starting to switch you know when things are seen to be done with the club Talk of the stadium being revamped you know new new new board and directors coming in um and certainly new coaching staff being involved in the team I think when things are seen to be done after such a period of stagnation in the club I think it does send a message to the players and I might be getting ahead of myself and yes I am wearing my man united tinted glasses but I do think that we're going to have an improvement on last season I do think you're going to start to see Garo really coming out as being a quality FPL asset and certainly a great Premier League star player I do think there's there's a lot of potential in him I hope he doesn't get ruined by um you know just what happens at United recent in recent years people just getting too big for their boots but certainly I think if he keeps his feet on the floor and uh calms himself down he could be a Quality quality player and and the same with M Ahmad as well I mean we've got some real good potential there and some youngsters coming through um a decent signings and I think that um I think you're right I think United shouldn't be laughed at I think you should be careful owning too many but certainly Bruno Fernandez is a great um a great start and then maybe in a few weeks time certainly some people might be looking to wild card game week four there might be it might be a shout for a Defender there might be I mean United you know could end up being pretty solid at the back this season um and it and we got some good Bargains there in defense that you can grab hold of if if that is the case and certainly in attack I mean you know the same again we've got some good price points there on players you know we got a gacho being one Ahad being another you know okay rashford I mean if he starts firing it could be um again a lot of attention could turn to man united like you said earlier on ash I mean you get laughed at now but it can easy change you know you know as well as I do the Wind of Change in FPL is quick there's a lot of there's a lot of reasons to be positive about man united this season and the reason why I settled on Bruno Fernandez is because I I like you say he he is guaranteed the minutes he they I knew they were going to start the season without a striker I knew he was going to be playing up front and that's what you want you want your players playing as far forward as possible he's on the set pieces he's on the penalties is like he is the main man um he also going for Bruno allows me to go to rashford if I want to if I want to go if rashford goes off on one then great the the question mark around rashford is just that form isn't it is is can he can he deliver consistently but also Sancho was back on the other side it was I really wanted to punt on Amad if I'm honest but yeah with um gacho probably going to be occupying that right side as well and Anthony who we've not even talked about there's a lot of competition for places there mounts back in the side they've got two new they got two Strikers now Ugarte might be on the move you know and they got a whole new defensive lines I think there's a lot of reasons to be positive and that's the reason why I really wanted to have someone from man united in my team and I'm glad I did even though he blanked three points for me Isn't a blank but apparently blank but he should have scored two he had the highest xgi for the for the game week so I'm really positive and he goes into a really good fixture next week well I watched Mark s's walking video in the woods earlier and he was talking about how at Fest a lot of people that owned Fernandez he was thinking what have I done why I get him in because he he genuinely was he scared the life at me because Jason has Fernandez and we've got like like you and Nick him they all look to him on the pitch they all look to Fernandez just create it's not just it's not just looking at him jaay it's the fact that he is the only one that looks with any threat and gar naturo as well he's the only one that wants to actually look like he wants to score a goal and I came away from that thinking bloody hell Jace could have had a 15 pointer from that guy and I'm sure for you Ash at Fest you must have come away from that game like what if yeah but that that is FPL though right it's a game of what ifs I think I take I take the positives that he was in the right positions and that he should have scored those two chances like one was fairly simple chance for him you you'd think that he would just gobble that one up usually um but I also feel like there's a there's a big owners Bruno puts on himself to deliver and you can tell by the reaction when he misses chances that he's like I just really want to do well and he just needs other people to want to have that same desire and chip in and people like xer come on scored a goal maybe that'll just relieve a bit of the pressure off of Bruno maybe he can just relax a little bit more on the pitch and and that'll bring out the best from him um but yeah I'm really pleased with having him in my team and I definitely want to see what he can do for the next few weeks competition competition for places cannot be underestimated and I think we're starting to see that now like you mentioned and I think that going to be potentially one of the main driving forces behind Improvement at United but St you about to say something well no I was just going to say with the the captaincy I mentioned your captain Salah who did actually end up being the highest scoring player this well game week one what made you choose him over the popular pick of of Isaac uh two reasons one that everyone went for Isaac or isach and and I didn't want to be like everybody else because it's boring and and two it's Salah and Salah always does well on the first day of the Season yeah and they were playing ipswitch away well that's true you could argue potentially a tough fixture in the sense of it's the first opening game of the season whatever the Bloody Grounds called I completely forgotten about it now but it doesn't really matter Portland Road that's it they could have been up for it blah blah blah blah blah but you are completely right Muhammad Salah away at a promoted team and by all accounts listening into what you guys were saying last night by the 60th minute IP Swit were just absolutely shattered and Salah could could have had more than what he got but like I mentioned Fest a thousand times and I am G to continue talk about because it's just talking at the end of the day having a conversation with a mate and what did you have your team already picked before getting to Fest and during Fest was there lots of chat from yourself with others about changing potentially some players or where you just set and forget I just want to enjoy myself at this particular event yeah I was very much with the latter mate I um I didn't actually get there until literally half 6 um okay and as you know you don't get any signal when you're on the tube so even if I wanted to make any last minute changes I couldn't and I was quite happy with that because I'd set my team up I'd spent weeks thinking about my team and I got I got it to a point that I was happy with it I was happy to run with that and there wasn't really GNA be that amount of news or leaks or whatever that was going to make me want to change that because I mean I think it's not a nice feeling when you're not it's not a nice feeling when you're not 100% about your team coming up to a deadline and different I'm set I was set yeah yeah um I think it was the the garnacho news got leaked that he was on the bench oh yeah yeah but again that didn't that didn't affect me if I had gotten atro then maybe I'd have been like bit oh I need to change it I need to get someone else in maybe move my team around but I went for brunai I knew he was going to start so I didn't have that worry um and when when I was there because the deadline had passed it wasn't really it was a non start it wasn't a topic for conversation because everyone's team was set then it was just about chat to people meeting people playing pool having a drink and then uh you weren't smoking the game no I don't quit I quit this year all year and drink what did you what did you think of Fest because I can't remember if you went last year or not no what the the Wi-Fi gate no I wasn't that Wi-Fi gate um but this year was really good really enjoyed it lots of friendly faces I think it was sold out um much better the last one um lots more there lots more to to have lots more to do in terms of amusement like you know what it's like what bles are like we just like to do stuff you know so there's a pool table there there was like um darts there there was um like basketball hoops and stuff there was lots of food stores obviously the bar the comedian there was things to do which obviously promotes socializing so from that perspective it was much much better um the venue was bigger nicer it was open as well it's a nice day which always helps when the sun's out and it's warm it just brings out the best in people um you made I was going to say you made an interesting comment last night because I always like analyzing your show and you made a very interesting comment cuz it's true which is you were more relaxed because you weren't there doing a job you were there as a fan and as just a regular guy that plays a game that you take seriously and you felt more relaxed yeah well I wasn't I wasn't working Al was doing that shout out Al because he was out there doing his uh doing his thing with the uh with the mic and the camera going and chatting to people which obviously I enjoy but when you're doing that means you can't really soak in the event and and relax and be part of it and then go around mingling not worrying about James shouting at you saying come over here and get on the screen and do this bit and do that bit and you know I'm not taking it for granted or anything but sometimes it's Nic just to go there and be part of it and experience it and and enjoy it um which I definitely did I felt like I had more meaningful conversations with people um because there wasn't that you know there wasn't a camera stuck in front of people in a microphone um so I mentioned the point on I can't remember if it was live on live streaming patreon I can't remember now but I'm GNA say it now I think personally FPL content on YouTube has already hit his Peak last year I think it's done now but what I have noticed which has started and I'll be honest with you I put it down to you you guys at FPL juice for starting it I think it's the live experience inperson experience which is now going to start slowly taking off you just mentioned Al FPL you've got a few guys now doing Studio based podcasts how do you feel about the fact that the in my opinion the next level from for FPL is going to be that that live experience because for me nothing beats being in person chatting with the likes of yourself Nick and so on and so forth than doing it over like what we're doing now what we're doing now is just convenience if we were able to go in a studio it's a more um an emotional affair so to speak we're really getting having a real proper conversation we're not getting these lag issues or whatnot and I do think that the live experience is is is coming soon and is it I I personally do put it down to as a testament to what you guys have brought to the community yeah I think that's just the next stage right that's the next step in the evolution of of podcasting you I don't know if you ever follow like um podcasters like shits and gigs I follow them those two guys they're just a couple of guys who just talk about random [ __ ] like they just and they just have a laugh with it but they've gone to a to a stage now where they're doing live audiences they're doing live crowds they're doing they sellout shows in stadiums they're just podcasters they're not musicians yeah they're not singers They're don't they're not actors they're just a of guys that chat and that people connect with and and that is definitely where it's going I mean we've we've tried obviously we do the F side tournaments we've gone live with um stuff at meets um we did the stream setion live didn't we at uh that bar in Victoria which is amazing as well um that was brilliant yeah great I mean James has con will and has continually tried to push us to do stuff in front of a live audience um I just don't think the appetite's been there for it with our community per se but that's not to say that it's not going to get there at some stage and I think that's where it's going to be heading um and you've seen from especially with yeah of course like and it's it's not even just um you know the banter between me and Nick we try and bring everyone in like if you if you're if you're joining us we'll have a laugh with you like we you know we want to know what you think we let have a laugh let's bring members of the audience in let's play games let's coax people out of their shells and show their personality because that's all that's all we are as people we're just people that want to show our personality have have fun um and that's just the that's just what we've tried to bring to the show and I think that would be the next step for us is doing like a live like like a live show in front of an audience would be would be amazing if we could get that going um who who's um who's running the the juice account at the moment in the uh in the chat by the way that's uh that's James yeah he's just put in the chat he's just put in the chat did someone say FPL juice live at Christmas question mark I mean we Tri we tried to do it we tried to do that last year we tried to throw a party so it was going to be like a Christmas party with a live studio like a live show in the venue and we sold like two tickets so then was was like H it's not really going to work just yeah but it's a year on now it's a year on more people more more of awareness you know you just never know you never know what like I just think I think Christmas is just a tough time because everyone busy like their family away with family and enjoying their holidays it's just a tough time where people are always really busy like Christmas parties with their work and stuff um it's definitely on the cards and if anyone's going to do it we're yell is up for it it seems it seems yell she's she's down for most of the stuff to be fair she's good hello shout out to um Sim in the chat as well some people in the chat just going to quickly just say hello to sim we got again yellow Army Rob um we've got uh Colm here M wot's here a lot of the juice fam here welcome welcome to the juice Fam thank you for being here I saw a few people saying juice raid in the chat earlier on so uh yeah thanks for coming over guys and big shout out to you guys and uh FPL juice is uh in the chat and if you're not already aware of their content then you need to go and make yourself aware of their content um but yeah I mean it's I think listening to what you're saying about live audience is it's a very um it adds such a dynamic to the show having a live audience and having reaction like it's it it makes it more alive if that makes sense like the the atmosphere makes the atmosphere more alive and certainly in in Talking Football and and talking you know topic surrounding football um having having multiple people there with you and the audience willing that more to life so to speak and I think that's that's going to be for me where I see your show and many others going because like you said that's what you you aspire to get to I think with the panel the panels you've got and the studio you have it's like a natural progression is that is the next step get getting to that point where you can invite in an audience and having um events and and such and such which will again just Snowball the the engagement and the um you know the the fun you know it creates more fun and more you know dynamic towards a show and I think that's where I see you guys going whether it be Christmas whether it be next year or the year after I I do I do see that happening I've been saying for so long that FPL needs more independent um Studio based podcasts format shows um and and obviously you guys came along and I was like whoa like this is just how iag like me and steo like four years ago it's just how I imagined we we could got like get a unit somewhere and set something up but obviously you guys have literally set everything up to the such a professional level uh it kind of It kind of you know has raised the bar when it comes to um you know independent FPL content on YouTube and and other and other platforms and it's a it's a great it's a great um Testament to the time and effort that's gone in behind the scenes really you can tell straight away and um you know it's a breath of fresh air as well cuz it's not just someone trying to emulate someone else there's been lots of people that have meant well but they've not brought something new to the scene and I think you did bring something you need to have seen it was and and personally one of my favorite things about your show is that you don't take yourself too seriously and there is comedy and when there's comedy even if the subject is not of your interest and but you we throw a bit of comedy in it suddenly makes it so much more so much more digestible to it for an audience member and yeah I think it's I think it's spot on and I think it's just going to go Str it's going to go stronger and stronger each as uh as time goes on um but guys if if I may thank if I if I may we we are moving to the point in the show where we start to predict now um predictions for the game week you know I know there's some fixtures there that I can kind of get gauge from from your previous comments where you see Man City versus Z switch I think that's a pretty obvious and there's a few others there which hey 5 nil 5 nil minimum minimum um uh would you guys be all right if we just move on to the uh the predictions yeah let go if I missed anything out I don't think we've missed anything out um yeah I think I think covering as has covered most of team I think there's not much else we can talk about he's had a Stormer of a week he's only 10 yeah there's a million places ahead of me hey yeah only a few points ahead of yeah no that's true only a few points ahead of you Jay you got what only a few but there's a million in in O between me and him what did you actually J what did you think when um what did you think when poro scored did you think of me or did you not I I I I did and I won't repeat what I did think I I you you you something yes yeah I'll leave it up to your imagination as to what I I said in my head when when I saw that uh launch pods in the in the house as well welcome to the studio Anytime by the way oh James is under many hats but yeah I um I I will eventually get to the studio and bask in its glor and uh take part in the shenanigans that that uh that takes place there and have a lot of fun I'm sure FPL fuzzy hello to you Buffy and many others yeah man definitely I mean uh I'd be all up for a Christmas show as well I'm sure my wife would let me out the house for for a few few [Music] hours um okay so let's kickoff then uh Brighton versus Manchester United is the lunchtime kickoff certainly steo was like not fan of lunchtime kickoffs um a May night being a way um I do think from my point of we can get a positive result out of this I do think Brighton will probably score uh I'll kick this one off and say two one to May United um Ash let's let's have your thoughts on this one Desmond it's going to be a two2 mate a 22 Yeah Point shared gonna take a lot of shots but I think they'll they'll score a couple as well I think there's going to be a couple of goals here both both attacking sides I've got I've got some I've got some good news and bad news for you Ash so the good news is that I'm going to be bringing you some basic history regarding the fixtures that are involved the bad news is that I'm going to be asking you a few questions um regarding go these particular fixtures so in this specific case there's only been one draw in the last six fixtures in all competitions when was the last time these Drew with one another 2018 you're wrong it was uh on the 23rd of April 2023 OH Close nil nil it was in the FA Cup it ended nil nil there's like I said there's not been a single draw in this match other than in that FA Cup particular fixture so no draws in the Premier League then no not there's been five matches in the last six and funny enough it's all in favor of an away away team an away team has won four times out of the last uh five ttes however on two occasions Brighton have one at home twice to nil 40 and 1 nil and me personally I think that there's a chance that Brighton could get a result against Man United and I'm going to reverse to you Jay I'm going 21 to right all across the board oh dear shot for the shot an arrow for my heart the chat is going with 2-1 to United Bri Harry dock is agreeing with you Brighton 2-1 Matthew going two one to Brighton um we got colem in one all agreeing with you Ash along with Wade Wilson mchi in the chat saying 4-nil Brighton wow uh Getty going 3-1 to United Bruno brace there's a lot there's a lot of variety here there's not a consensus there's not a general agreement in this one that would be perfect wouldn't it Chef chef's kiss it's a difficult game to call you've got a team in and who perform usually quite well at home but they've got a lot of players which are still trying to fit into the mix but they had a very positive result against Everton where he's got man united team who they've got some very good players but they don't seem to express themselves a lot but they did get a very when I say A positive result against Fulham I mean in the sense of it was within reason a kind of a positive game um from an attacking perspective so it it does sound like it could have like one one or two one either way written over I just want to give it to the home team jayon you g give it to the home team even though the history is giving it to the away team well Brighton Brighton have actually got a better fit in fact in fact Bri Brighton have only they've they've only lost once against man united in the last six and that was on the 19th of May this year yeah so baring that yeah to be honest I wouldn't be surprised personally them off now a no I listen I wouldn't be surprised if it is either way to be honest it's still very much early days for United's Resurgence but I I'm just being positive all right I'm trying to be positive uh Crystal Palace versus West Ham um three first first of the three o'clocks that we're going to talk about here um I know a few people got Crystal pal Palace assets I know I have um obviously want to bounce back um I I I can see this being a one all I'm going to I'm going to do a draw one all um now St let's have your opinion on this one what's history say well my immediate reaction in what you just said was a one-1 I'm thinking no I I have a feeling that Crystal Palace will will get a win here I do expect them to to concede a goal Jace so your Henderson pick was most likely going to concede is a question is a question for you Ash and then I'll ask Jace as well so a question to you both basically how many goals including in a friendly have been scored in the last six fixtures how many goals so Ash how many goals in the last six fixtures in the last six fixures total goals total goals have been scored in this 12 Jace in the last six fixtures the last six fixtures in all competitions how many goals have been scored in total nine 28 what 28 goals have been scored goals to be honest to be honest I should have known I should have known it was going to be ridiculous because you would have brought the way you brought that up how many goals have been scored like okay we've had a unless my MTH is terrible here but we've had 28 32 21 43 1 1 52 31 who's scoring all these goals well I I'll ask the question Ash the last time these play each other here we go Ash this is a a quiz for you the last time these two played each other was on the 21st of April this year it ended 52 did H the question for you is who scored the second goal for West Ham come on ash you're normally really good at these quizzes bro you're asking me about a random game from a random season and you're the random goal it was last season Ash and it was in April so soak Jason J no it was uh it was Dean hend do me a favor you taking the right can you just go can you take can you take your trivia questions and shove them where the sunnd what's going on bro this is bang out of order done it on purpose a loaded question you're WR yes so I'm personally gonna go with a a 21 in this fix toj you're going one1 but Ash what are you think in this game uh I think Palace played well against brenford they're going to have to deal with the loss of Anderson but Mata could be back fit because he only played 45 minutes EA looked like really Lively in that game um and West West Ham I can't really remember West Ham's performance it was that remember memorable they lost 2-1 to at home to Villa right Y and they weren't great yeah so new team new players new manager maybe still trying to figure things out I'm going to go for a go for a one nil Palace one nil to Palace I'll take that all day long um then we move on to the Fulham game Fulham a lot of people with Fulham assets and hoping that they'll uh they'll prove everyone's uh you know gameweek one strategy right by owning them um versus Leicester now is this going to be the game that people judge their Fulham assets on like is this going to be the right if if if they blank against Leicester at home I'm getting them gone I think a lot of people probably lose play patience with Fulham so um I'm GNA in fact I'm gonna go last I'm gonna let Ash go first on this one yeah I think uh let's TR a good second half against Spurs but I think Spurs did play into their hand Spurs only have one way of playing I think f are a bit more tactically uh tactically aware um I think maros Silva is quite a good manager um and uh they'll want to kick this season off with a good home win um and I'm gonna back my boy co Boer and I'm gonna say two nil to Fulham goals from Smith row and random Defender castana about that what sorry what was your prediction two nil for two two n is that the same castania that was benched against man united yeah that guy steo Ash's gone two n to Fulham uh have you got a different in a different perspective to to give on this well funny enough I actually had two- n in my head and that's exactly what I'm gonna go with I'm gonna go two cop him well hold on a minute here we're goingon to be asking a question in a minute do you want to make you hard what's the history say well hold a minute let me just give my thoughts on why I think it's going to be two nil I was going to say not Forest then because of Steve Cooper He's goingon to be going into this game not wanting to to lose and he'll be set up for the counter and Silva's going to know this and I think they've just got the quality it's a championship team this this Leicester side and I just think that filam have got that quality like like ash said the likes of Smith row munz Robinson who I remember you as was saying he's definitely going to be my team and you didn't you did say that I probably know I think you said it on the 13th of August episode call him a fraud go on I know you want yeah but I think it's going to be like a it should be a clean sheet I'm gonna go 2N Jace before I ask the trivia question what are you going with 21 I'm MC green with yellow Army in the chat 21 and hello to new people tuning in um it's SK in the chat um as well saying yes Ash up the juice um I yeah 2-1 2-1 to Fulham I think they will concede but I think they will win and it will be a comfortable win although a narrow margin they'll be fine the last time this game ended 2-nil to a team at Fulham was actually for Leicester the question for you Ash is which player got two assists in that game for Leicester Markel Brighton he did play that day but he was a substitute so is that the right answer it was not the right answer okay damn it it was a player that plays for Tottenham Madison well done Jason you got Jam Madison got a clue now you got a clue I didn't get a clue up out on give me a clue it wasn't directly for Jason it was for both of you you could have both answered that it was for both okay yeah okay I was helping you out Ash right cheers bro thank you I got right we share the points nice one go on Chase we're going to move on to Ash's okay moving moving on to the main event Ash's Main Event certainly of the of the game week Man City versus IP switch Ash has said 5- nil uh maybe is it tongue and cheek or is it genuine you actually think you 5 nil mate 5 nil 5 nil can't tell that's not mate if I go and check the bookies odds on 5 nil now bet it's probably about even money it's not unrealistic it's it's not unrealistic I think this this is one of those where up at half time you'll be like it's one of these games it's one of it's one of these games where I think that it City will score as many as they want and it could be one of those games where they'll get to two or three nil up and they just go on cruise control and they just pass it around and they don't push more than three or four goals it's one of those games where they can be in control to the extent of dictating everything that happens on the pitch like I just said um so I've seen Man City before in games like this where they on paper they're just literally the massive favorites and they've just literally settled with a two two three goals and they've just set up shop and finish the game and seen the game out um I I see IP switch very much the way I saw my team luten in the Premier League last season they're a newly promoted side a lot of with a lot of yeah whipping boys literally we were the went off through the playoffs we were probably the weakest team in the league on paper I switch are probably the weakest team in the league on paper they're going to the aad when Luton went to the aad last season we kept them quiet for like 25 minutes and then the floodgates just opened and then it was five and it could have been more so I just see it I just see it a similar pattern so George in the chat saying it could be either 2-0 or 7 nil you know what I can agree I mean it could be one of those games where it's just all city and it ends 2-0 but it could literally be what like ash is saying it could just be an absolute avalanch of goals and you know it it it's going to be one of those where if you've got your triple captain on a on a man city asset I.E Harland you're going in super confident if you haven't and your Rivals have you're going in super nervous because like there's probably not going to be many better opportunities for trouble Captain um than this fixture this early obviously I know um some people are holding on to their chips until later on in the season but like we spoke about earlier on in the show I think you've got the ability to to set yourself up uh and Propel yourself up there early on in the season so other people are having to make having to make those you know those risky decisions to try and catch up with you um okay yeah so I I I think um right so so you you're 5 nil yeah yeah five what do you bro I just double checking I'm like okay okay okay I'm going to go one less I'm going to go one less I'm going to 40 40 steo I think the question is going to be what player is actually best to be triple captain in that game now obviously the answer is gonna be howand but if you've got dohu or foden okay maybe take a punt on them because I I have a feeling Ash that even though the triple captaincy is the right decision I have a feeling whispering quietly that someone like doku Silva foden Walker Diaz is probably going to come out point I I have this feeling I don't know why that dku is gonna do what he did against that team whoever it was um a couple of seasons ago was it last season when he got the 21p pointer that's what I think is going to happen I I do expect hanen to return obviously I'm stating the bloody obvious but see I think Kevin De bruyne is the one that's going to yeah I think he's going to be the one that's going to haul and he's going to be like the the thing is is like I could see this game being like good points for Haren don't get me wrong I think he could easily get like you said a minimum of two a brace but I do see kdb as being that like that sort of that differential in this game that's so lowly owned that if you owned I'm I'm going to say it right now if you own KD B and Harland in your FPL team triple Captain kdb yes because you've got yeah yeah yeah yeah oh yeah because you've got such a differential there it's ridiculous like I could see KD B in this fixture matching if not outscoring Harland but people aren't going to have the minerals to do that people will stick with they'll STI safety in there's safety in numbers there is safety in numbers but I think that if you've got kdb in your team you've got him in for a reason right you've got him in for reason against the against like you said the whipping boys of I switch just just take take take it on take you know sword use that sword and and and take the game week on full force and trible Captain kdb go for I don't hate I don't hate the kdb thing like I I I if you have got KD B I mean this is a great fixture to have him in I just I just looked just watched a lot of kdb in the Chelsea game and I I feel like he was just in second gear for the most of the game he didn't really still getting up to he's still recovering when like from the Euro I think I think he was not he's not fully fit and that's probably kind of playing into the idea that it's probably not a good idea to Triple Captain him because he probably isn't fully fit to be fair yeah exact exactly if he's not fully fit why are you going to but does he need to be fully fit against dip switch so sorry sorry so does he need fully fit against dip switch well what do you think is going to be like more profitable for you to have a fully fit starting forward in Harland with a proven goal record who's absolutely hungry every single game to score as many goals as possible who's had the whole summer off with no other competition for his place against a maybe half fit kdb who did play during the summer with loads of competition for his place I mean we try and over complicate this game right steo asked me earlier why did I go simple he was playing IP switch and he's the best player that I had playing against the best the weakest team that's pretty much it it's the same with this got the best player playing against one of the weakest teams I really don't think it's any more consider needs any more consideration than that yeah yeah yeah you don't have to be clever just keep it simple right yeah absolutely um Jason's almost making me Jason almost making me taking minus four switch sacka into kdb and switch Tri captaincy to him listen um I think that that would be an absolute baller move and I think that to be honest I think if I had the balls to do something like that I would do it I I don't you used I used to but yeah I think I think that I I yeah had a child that's [Music] why um okay so um steo well I I I generally am going with one more than Ash I'm going six I think it's oh okay an absolute I think everybody's going to be going with four five six nil and like you said it will probably end up being one nil but the last time these two played in the Premier League at Manchester City's ground it ended 32 but Ash what year was this in uh that's that would have been when it in the pr maybe it Prem leag in the 90s yeah I would say I would say 90 I'm gonna I'm gonna go 96 96 okay Ash 97 9596 25th of the 11th 2000 when it Man City 32 it switch in the Premier League in 2000 they were indeed yes in fact it oh my God between 1999 to 2002 only lost twice to Man City so wait am I living in an alternative reality I switch were in the Premier League in the year 2000 yes they were was it was it one season and they got they they were just up and then relegated straight after that was I I'm I'm not I I am I blown away I am Absol the days of like Matty Holland and Marcus Stewart and Marcus bent that I can't believe that I cannot I'm I'm genuinely shocked um okay uh is that it for trivia questions on that one okay Southampton versus nottingam Forest I'm just half I've got the second half of ET to watch with my family when I finish this all right so come on let's I'm just getting Ash back for giving me m and bloody mount for my guess the player but still you still Ste you gotta let it go come make like frozen you got move on uh South abon versus n Forest a game where I have absolutely got no interest in um and I really don't care about this I don't care if it's just nil nil so I'm going to go nil nil um yeah nil nil what's your thoughts uh steo I think this is going to be actually quite uh not high I'm confusing myself with what I'm looking at here this is normally a high scoring game in the last six fixtures there's been a lot of Threes 31 32 3 n 43 lots of goals in this fixture I actually expect Southampton to win here if going draw in the chat he's a Southampton fan I I think that genuinely Southampton are going to win this I'm going to go 2-1 Ash uh yeah I think there'll be goals in this game Southampton looked pretty good against Newcastle last game they've um bolstered their attack in line with uh Cameron Archer and Britain Diaz um and they'll be up for it they'll be looking to get their first win of the Season they'll be targeting this as a potential threep points I just think Forest are are a good solid side and they've got a goal scorer they've got a goal scorer in Chris would so I think it's going to be 21 to Forest 2-1 to Forest the question though is the last time these played was actually on the 4th of January 2023 this was in the Premier League aan scored in the 27th minute in a 1- nil win which current Tottenham player assisted a wait what in the Premier League won year Southampton won in the Premier League last season on the 4th of January 20123 yeah January 2023 yeah so last year so Southampton wen't in the Premier League last year they were in championship in the the 2022 2023 season wouldn't it that would have been in the 2022 23 season yeah oh okay this was January and last year was the 2023 24 and now we're in the 20242 right okay are you questioning the quiz Master yeah mate qu Master you I need to fact I need to fact check all of this well we got some answers in the chat so don't cheat now who who was the Tottenham player that assisted our knee or no good guess good guess he was playing that day Jason would you have any idea which current Johnson I should have said current but it doesn't really matter Brandon Johnson yep you're bang on the money but I think you're Che Jason so w allow that you're a fraud right I've just looked this up I have gone until the Premier League website and IP switch were not only in the Premier League in 2002 2001 season manager George Burley top goal scorer was Marcus Stewart right they finished fifth place and in the chat they said they got qualified for Europe that's crazy yeah and and the season before that do you want to have a guess before the 2001 season what was the season that they were last in the Premier League before that what was the years well I know it was um well had it in front of me 1999 wasn't it NOP 96 no 95 no 92 94 95 94 95 so that's when they were last in it yes 94 95 and then 2000 2001 and the chat were right they finished fifth they got promot they not not promoted they got they qualified for Europe that's mental I must have not watched football that season year before that then the year before they finished fifth what where were they what league were they in they must have been in the championship because because they they must have been division old division one yeah because I've gone on the Premier League um season history for for IP switch and yeah I'll post it in the chat if for those that are wanting to double check it but yeah 2001 20201 I remember when when the Premier League was first like around in like what was it 92 and it switch toown in a team then with those players that I mentioned Herman horid was it Herman horid or was he no he was Charon so the same days like Char i' win Premier League I don't remember him ever being there in 2000 that is I don't remember him being there in 2000 and I I've got the I've got the shirt in front of me the green King sponsor and I just cannot remember it at all but again it was it was the the season where the world was going to end wasn't it the Millennium the yeah anyway um I let's move on otherwise we're never we're never going to get through these games Spurs versus Everton um I think on from on paper should be a pretty straightforward result I think we probably all agree on Spurs coming out on top on this one guys I think it's just a matter of score line right so I'm going to go 2-0 to Spurs anyone want to go with me or two1 Spurs oh you expect Everton score there's been a lot of red cards in this fixture in fact there's been three specifically in this particular fixture across the last six the the it's not really been high scoring apart from once and we're going to we're going to do a question on this for ash apart from Once when they won 5 nil I I think it's going to be just I'm gonna go one more than Jason I'm G to go 3 nil in that particular game Ash where Tottenham beat Everton 5 n mhm which player got two assists for both of Harry Kane's goals in that particular fixture player assisted Kane twice what year this was in 2022 and this is for ash right this is for ash yeah 2022 which player assisted came twice uh five win no that's too obvious I like Harry a big unfortunately he had a is a bit of a clue he had a big big reputation coming to Tottenham he did extremely well for the Premier League club he joined from unfortunately he just didn't seem to play for Tottenham whatsoever he failed m unfortunately and I believe he's back at the club that sold to Tottenham any clue there Jace my brain's not working right now I try not to keep up to date with tottenham's transfers if this helps in goal oh I know in goal was lce R yes yeah yeah he's gone back to the club think about it think about it he's gone back to the Club come on it's one one player that came with a lot of hype he was an FPL favorite for a certain Club he played in defense that's a big clue yeah come on ash come on W wolves player wolves player oh yeah yeah yes that's the one Matt Dockery I'm I'm beginning to question Ash the fact that when you seem to be on your own show you you're very very very good with football knowledge he's got it all written down in front of him that you're on another Channel you don't have a clue God damn now you know why I've avoided podcast so long right I nor I normally back you with this top 10K nonsense with your brother but I'm beginning to question M these questions are so Random like come on he has he's been meticulous 5 I to remember that remember what after breakfast to be fair that he did give a good clue about saying that he came to the club with great hype and then didn't succeed and went back to it well no but from an FPL point of view from an FPL from an FPL Point VI do me a favor that's a terrible okay uh Aston Villa versus Arsenal ladies and gentlemen is next on the list um I think this is going to be a cork of a game I really do this the 530 game I think there's going to be chances both ends and I think there's going to be goals for both teams in this do I see one team pulling ahead and getting like a 31 no I think 2-1 2-1 to Arsenal nice or 3-2 to Arsenal 2-1 to Arsenal I'm in the mindset of I think this is going to be a really a a tight end to end game I think both defenses are going to be keeping each other at tested I think they're going to be tested but I think it's one of those games where they know neither team wants to lose and I think this has got one nil either way written over it but I'm gonna go with Arsenal I'm gonna go one nil to Arsenal Ash yeah some Sound Logic there from you I was thinking in my head this is going to be tight and uh uh I think Arsenal will have revenge on their mind because they basically lost the title when they lost uh at home to Villa back end the last season and they'll want to get one one back on on these guys so I'm going to go one- nil Arsenal as well I'm GNA join you steo well the last time here we go Ash the last time bring it baby beat Aston Villa one nil sacka scored that goal the question for you as though Ash sorry is who was playing up front for Arsenal that day uh you want a CL Anda he came he came as a substitute for this player oh oh is he French laaz that yeah jaay he's stolen it oh no freaking way I didn't sh Jason brother that's I didn't I'm actually as surprised I'm as surprised as you are right now that I actually got that right what's on that piece of paper there you mean you mean this one here Ash this is the winners of elite FP no no no literally I literally was trying to Rack my brains and think ah Striker for Arsenal okay and KY was playing okay that right yeah that would have been a better question though which player came on for lacazette in that game in which I would have got perfect I would have got perect oh that would you would easy yeah that would have been that would have been too easy for you um bourma versus Newcastle is the first of the Sunday games at 2 o'clock um of course many people owning Isaac and maybe Gordon um have Newcastle failed to impress so far and is this the game where their ownership's going to be justified um I think personally Bournemouth despite being at home are going to lose this game and I'm going to go with a two-nil win to the Newcastle Ash yeah I don't think we've had a chance really to see what Newcastle are looking like this season the early red just as we all know it completely changes changes matches everything goes out the window in terms of game plan you end up becoming really tight and pack and trying to play on the breaks and stuff um yeah Eddie how going back to his old Club I can and and Bournemouth without sanii I mean he was the only real player like they had a good little team but they're they're they're a high they're they're a good lower Premier League team with salanki in it with salanki out it's really going to affect them and they've just got this new Brazilian guy he going to need some time um and they' basically got are you predicting Bournemouth to be relegated I think they'll be down in the bottom six yeah I think they'll I think they might find themselves in in the midst of it if they're not careful I did predict that for brenford until I saw him the other day as well though so take that a pinch of salt but I think Newcastle go down to Bournemouth and I think they probably beat him two-nil okay two okay Ste I I I think Bournemouth scoring this game I can't see I think they'll be up for it I know Dan lives down there there's a big big local following for Bournemouth and but I I I don't think they win though I think newcast actually I think say it quietly they win quite comfortably and I'm one of these people when it comes to fpl that when a a popular pick doesn't do well one game week but it's then the following game week when they're not expecting anything they pop off so I wouldn't be surprised if Isaac was to get like a double digit Hall if not a hattick maybe I don't think that's going to happen but certainly I'm expecting should have should yeah I think that Newcastle are going to win this I'm going to go with I'm going to go with 3-1 to Newcastle but Ash talking of hat tricks don't the last time Newcastle beat Bournemouth at Bournemouth ground it ended 41 it was a six o'clock kickoff on a Wednesday evening which player got a hatrick of assists that evening was that in the Prem or in the cup it was in the Premier League of the 2019 2020 season is it a random midfielder nope a very very popular midfielder for Newcastle uh alaron no he was a substitute that day long staff he he scored that day he didn't assist but I hate this game Joe Linton uh Joe Linton was playing on the left hand side up know what I hate this game he's not made it easy for you at all mate I I I I I've got nothing to do when did uh when did when did Bruno Gomez sign from if you tell me that's Bruno is the right answer I'm literally I'm Gonna Leave bro well I would have thought you would have left about four hours ago he he he he hung around for 50 minutes for us to get our [ __ ] together at the start of the show such is my love for you guys Jason oh my God just read chat all right yeah okay it makes sense okay no it's obvious let's get okay um let's try and give Ash more clues um the first opening goal scorer that he assisted was Dwight Gil um Matt Richie didn't play that day in fact you another clue Ash do you want another clue yeah double barrel surname double barreled come on I I've listened to your on left if if you are okay okay I'll give you a big clue barel surname for Newcastle if if you if you are if you okay okay no think think religious name what Jesus religious like if you live if you reside in the heavens you are a saint oh maxan y well done we basically gave you the answer well we got there we had to get there didn't we now we're at my level now we're talking [Laughter] chinola I can't wait for ash to be slagging us off behind the scenes you'll be recording that for members only won't you just ask when when it comes to questions when I come on the show just remember I was good to you right oh yeah don't worry I'll store it all up here mate yeah yeah I you know I I I don't condone these these these low ballers from steo I must admit steo is in for a surprise when he comes in next I tell you 18 tons worth of pepper songs something to throw it in my [Laughter] face wolves versus Chelsea come on let's get through these wolves versus Chelsea um steo don't laugh and drink at the same time I wouldn't okay Ash go first on this one wolves chelse we'll see oh okay um I'm thinking one each on this one I don't know why two two two difficult teams to kind of predict at the moment um yeah wolves have lost kilman they've lost Netto they don't seem to have a sort of recognized a decent Striker Chelsea we seen what sort of shambles there at the moment so yeah I'm going to go for a one each and then kungu to get off the mark I like that prediction I generally do I think walls are very tough to break down but like we discussed earlier chelia still trying to fit together a a team trying to fit which jigsaw pieces fit into to fit which piece of The Jig s into where they fit within the team's convolute as that Bloody sounds which pieces fit where yeah yeah I'm going to go with the same score line I'm I'm going to go one one as well Jason I'm not g I'm not gonna give wolves a goal I'm gonna give Chelsea a goal one nil to Chelsea in this fixture and I wouldn't be surprised if enu is involved in it somewhere down the line well Ash mentioned that anuku scored last time in a 2-1 loss but Ash who assisted and cuckoo uh was it Sterling bloody hell ladies and gentlemen in chat big round of applause for ash give him a big round of applause he actually got it right here a question when was that goal scored which minute 70 seconds oh you you're back to 95th gy gy in the gy in the chat says one nil to wolves and then kinku drops to 6.4 million no win no way Chelsea wins this uh has been said in the chat as well um a lot of people uh pretty much wanted to go towards the uh the win for wolves nasty balls going two1 to wolves Harry doery who is a Blues fan of course 2-0 um one all krennic uh Wade Wilson saying two1 sh yeah I think no I I think um I think it's GNA be a tight game to be honest I think there's not going to be much in it uh and to wrap it up we've got Liverpool versus brenford um which is at anfield half past four kickoff steo prediction on this one I'm I'm actually dreading this game more than the man city game because I don't own more than one lither pal asset I've only got jot and that worries me I wish I had Trent minimum of Trent and J I don't have that I only have J and I'm worried that UJS have got Trent I'm worried that Ash has got Salah Salah this goal in the history has got goals goals goal written all over you got 33 3 n 31 1 n 3 n 41 wow and I had in my head 3-1 so that's what I'm going to do Jake I'm gonna go 3-1 despite the fact history suggest Liverpool will keep a clean sheet at anfield because it's been 3 nil 1 nil 3 nil at anfield so yeah I'm going to go 3-1 though 31 okay uh Ash yeah I'm on that as well I'm on 3-1 I was thinking 3-0 I think there'll be I I'll get at least three goals hopefully salah's part of all three of them the way the way they're geared up it's like they he is still going to be the focal point of their attack which is great for me um but I do think brenford do carry some real like real goal threat in terms of bumo WIA is very underrated player I think and Kevin shade as well or Shard day as they're calling him um they they've got some real goal threat there so yeah 3-1 to Liverpool I'm taking the goal away from um from Bradford I'm going to go to uh 3-0 uh straightforward 3-0 win for Liverpool steo take away okay well the last time this game ended 31 was at brentford's ground on the 2nd of January which was a Monday evening 5:30 kickoff who scored Liverpool's one single goal Ash OH mate mallister I don't even think he play wow what year was this sorry this was in the year 2023 January the 2nd 2023 single goal for Liverpool yeah one player scored one goal in a three the last time this ended three Harvey Elliot no but he was playing that day Trent was it Trent uh Trent got the assist Jones who Curtis Jones Curtis Jones no Curtis Jones no he did come on Van dijk no van dijk no don't tell me it was a goalie was it the one goalie scored in no it was one of the front three Nunez up top Sal and gakpo gakpo nope it was on the left hand side though Ash Diaz's position Diaz No this player did come from a rival a top four rival the hell I'm getting confused now in fact I don't even know where this player even ended up going to you didn't even know he played for them this is obviously this is obviously an obscure player it's not no this this player came from a top four rival performed very well for that top four team but due to injuries was let go Liverpool bought him he did okay but I don't even know where he's gone now [Music] oh and uh talking of double barrel names it's a double barrel name Ash o Chamberlain the ox you've got it in one I heard a lot of typing there so a lot I wouldn't have got that I wouldn't have got that I've forgotten about I've forgotten about oxl Chamberlain he's in um he went to Turkey didn't he oh you seem to know that how do you yeah Google's still working fine on my computer mental and there we have it gentlemen that's the predictions over done with in all seriousness I think that look most of the games is how we all expect them to go maybe a few different opinions on walls the Newcastle game Bri game but overall I think that a lot of these games are going to go the way that we think the the biggest the one question before we finally get out of here Ash for you would be what would be a shock result for you to happen this particular weekend so for instance I'll give you my one it would be something like if brenford were to beat Liverpool or a real shock would be if ipswitch only lost one nil to man city is there any results here that are a bit of a what youim call it a a banana skin for you um yeah just I think I'd agree with you on those ones to be honest with you if Liverpool didn't pick up three points at home to brenford that would be a shock if Man City didn't pick up three points at home to hip switch that would be a shock obviously they would say whatever the score is as long as they win They Don't Really Care um I think it should be a high scoring game but we' know we do know that when Man City have come up against low low block opposition sometimes they can struggle to break them down and takes them quite a long time so they'd take a one nil at home I'm sure they would against Z switch I wouldn't be happy with that but um yeah aside from that you can look at the rest of the fixures and this is the thing with the Premier League because Man City and Arsenal are so far clear and I think Liverpool are third and then I think it's and then I think it's Manu Tottenham Chelsea Newcastle Villa is our next batch and then the and then you got the three that got promoted who obviously the weakest SI and then you've got the rest and they can all beat each other on their day yeah so you look at the rest of the fixtures and you wouldn't be surprised if um say West Ham beat Palace or Bournemouth beat Newcastle you wouldn't be surprised if Bournemouth beat Newcastle at home um so so close are the teams so much so so many fine margins in in the Premier League now but yeah I think those two are the only ones that would be a real like if it if it if it went wrong yeah and like like I say as we wrap up I think I really genuinely wish you luck for that hen triple captaincy because you have made so many you not tempted steo I mean ironically no because I just feel that maybe later down the line it could be used more effectively but again this is a perfect fixture for yeah you be thinking of me as you're watching the game as you're watching yeah I be thinking John Harris but uh who's johnis who's John haris Jason G just do an impression of him all right as my name's John Aris I come from Birmingham Oh I thought he was [Laughter] Jamaican crazy yeah it's uh yeah was he rer hey was he roster no that was supposed to that was supposed to be a grummy accent but you know um he's I hope he watching I because he he probably cringes when I do that to be fair U no um it's that's I think that's a wrap Now ladies and gentlemen I think um first and foremost a massive thank you yet

back to the fantasy football fix YouTube channel and to another episode of Eddie versus the algorithm this time for game week 2 the series here on FPL YouTube where I put my own free hit team of the week up against the algorithm's AI highest predicted Point scoring team for that game week of the season last week it was a very very highs scoring uh week for both teams so the AI scoring very very well in the high 80s but my score in the '90s did actually end up beating the algorithm team I was able to go without the likes of Man City assets though etc etc so I do have that benefit of being on the free hit in this series every week of the Season let's see if we can hopefully get a good performance once more this week and make it 2-n to myself as we perform this feat over the entire 38 game weeks of the season so that makes the score 1 n as we head into game week two now if you are new around here then do make sure to subscribe the last video got a lot of support so thank you very much so if you're one of the new people around here do make sure to hit that button and if you're a returning viewer and thanks very much to you as well for continuing to support the series as we get into having a look at the algorithm's highest predicted Point scoring side for game week [Music] 2 and so you can see the score will be updated throughout the series at the bottom of your screen now you can see that nicely says eddie1 algorithm zero so we got 38 points up the grabs over the course of the Season we'll see what the score ends up being and whether or not I can beat the algorithm once more over a season this week the algorithm is predicted 68 points and to do that it's put together this 11 in a 4-33 formation and in goal for the Alo side this week it's going to be Leno so one of the more favorable fixures defensively Lester at home does look like a good opportunity for a side to keep a clean sheet Fulham have recently just invested a little bit more in their defense they've made a few signings in fact they brought in Anderson from Crystal Palace they've brought in sander ber as well who looks like a great signing not sure either of those options will be actually fit ready and available to get straight into the team and have trained enough with the side to be just thrown straight into the 11 for this weekend's fixture however it is promising for the Fulham defense that they are investing in the back and they do have some very capable Defenders already at the club Leno is one of those goalkeepers who's got a very fantastic FPL record for his price uh so he's often pric very cheap and he does make good saves he is one of those Keepers who's pretty decent at preventing XGC instead of being those ones who doesn't make many saves and tends to concede quite a lot of goals so he he's definitely not partial to a 10 plus pointer and this could be a good option just to maybe Bank six or seven points if Fulham do manage to keep the clean sheet he is very good in the bonus as well so I wouldn't write him off that if Fulham do in fact manage to keep Leicester out in that one in defense we're going to see a back four with TR Ander rnold Robinson Ruben Dash and then Munos of Crystal Palace so a pretty standard back line all apart from one option I would say Ruben Diaz is one that you're not going to see in many teams but is the Man City asset of choice that the algorithm has decided to go for wouldn't be my pick you'll see in my side in a minute if I've decided to go for a man city option who that is but the other three I do really like you've got three home fixtures for Liverpool as I already mentioned we've already talked about Fulham with Robinson and then Muno Crystal Palace who looked very attacking picked up an assist for that own goal in gameweek one so he's continued to get forward and do well for that Crystal pal side he could have had a lot more goals to be honest in game week one so you've got three very attacking fullbacks there with home fixtures very favorable oppositions there's not really too much to complain about there and there are a few other options you can pick up but overall you know these options are ones that look like they could deliver Robinson's got good assist threat we know about Trent already and overall you know I can see why the algorithms decided to go maybe a little bit more investment in the defense for this game week uh we'll move into the Midfield then and have a look at Midfield 3 which I assume is going to at least have yeah one locked in player that is M Salah it's then gone with Arabi and then also Kevin De bruyne who is a differential that I have to admit I do like the look of a lot and I didn't think too much about when I was putting together my own team for this week now I think the reason for this is probably in my brain and in a lot of your brains we can't really afford the BR at the moment you've got sacka whoever else you've got in your premum Midfield you Salah and Harland to afford Kevin De bruyne has just never really been an option he's been one that hasn't got the same upside maybe as some of those other premium Midfield options uh and when you've got so much funds invested elsewhere it's hard to get de bruyne into his side but he's one that it's going to have to be relied upon especially for these first few game weeks of the Season as players like foden uh reintroduced back into the starting 11 and given more minutes Dey played well against Chelsea he could easily be the one feeding harand for this game we because we've seen time and time again as Man City take on I switch at home you can't really ask for a better fixture than that over the entire season really so a very favorable fixure there and a player that if I had the money for my side maybe I would have gone for I've opted for a different option in there and then finally e who did blank in get Wick one but definitely shouldn't have blanked whether that's down to refereeing decisions whether it's down to players missing chances not holding their runs just a little bit I was very scared watching that as someone who doesn't own a in my own team and that kind of says a lot I'm even considered transferring him in for game week two because of how much I feared not owning him how good he looked during that game how I feel that when you know eventually the points do come they're going to come in great quantity so e quite rightly makes it into this 11 against the West Ham side who didn't look too bad in game week one but are one of those oppositions that you're not going to be afraid of targeting with your assets this season and then finally we're going to see the forwards who is going to consist of of course erling Harland who takes the captain's arm band we've then got mice and we've got Chris Wood as well so I can see where those funds have been kind of come from it's gone with the two budget Strikers who do look very good Chris Wood grabbed a goal and Max bonus in game week one he's away at Southampton where again you kind of back Nottingham Forest to to grab a goal or two there at least there are rumors around Eddie and keia but that deal is even if it does get you know bit accepted it's not going to get finalized not going to get in uh for game week two so you'd imagine Chris Wood will see quite a few minutes again this game week and a good chance of another goal in that one and then munise who some people might have had on the bench against Manchester United in game week one did look a little bit quiet uh to be honest but Fulham these are the fixtures now game week two to game week five where you really back them and that completes a Fulham triple up in this case so there are other options in that Fulham team they've added uh some extra Firepower but mise is definitely going to be the one uh who's playing up front the majority of the time you've got himz on the bench who might take some minutes away from him he's not the most secure uh four expected minutes and it is that 70 minute Mark where you could see mun coming off for Jimenez at quite a few points this season but Lester at home if you're not going to back him in that fixture you've got to back him in this one otherwise you're not going to back him in any fixture basically and I think it's a good week to for Mooney's owners and should be excited for this game week I reckon on the bench then just to round things up we've got Winks Howard Bellis and tribia which is a bit weird to have a Textra what two million tucked away there down there on the bench for a player who didn't even start last game we seems a bit bizarre to me but the algorithm does weird things when it has funds left over sometimes so with that being said we've got 68 predicted points for this one my team was predicted 66 let's take a look at my side now and how it Compares against the algorithms [Music] so I've also gone for a four at the back formation I've just gone for a 442 instead and I've got some very similar Personnel that you'll recognize from the other team in this side too so a bit of the defense looks the same you've got Trenton Robinson in there however as a bit of a differential cheeky punt I've gone with Mitchell instead of Munos he had a good chance and front a goal in the game in game week one Mitchell and I think that maybe being a bit overshadowed by his fullback counterpart on the other side of the pitch so I just thought maybe I'll take a cheeky stab at him and maybe that will pay off I've then gone with Rico Lewis as my man city defensive option of choice now he should play hopefully in this game in game week two with Walker and of not getting too many minutes uh the start of this season there's always that risk with pep that maybe he doesn't or maybe it's an early sub for Rico Lewis we've seen that in the past but if he does start vardal is more tucking uh sitting back rather Rico Lewis is the one inverting getting forward getting to the by line even sometimes we saw that against Chelsea and that's why I've decided to take the bit of a a punt and go for him instead of vardal even who would be a more secure minutes option I've on with Vicario in goal just to kind of get an extra fixture in there against a different team spread the clean sheet uh odds a little bit and go with the Spurs man and I've also got my another Spurs man in Midfield I've decided to back yum Minon in this game against Everton I want to see him getting inside a bit more I'm hoping we will see that he did kind of drift in and make a few chances for salanki but in game week one Leicester were really overcrowding uh the big man up top for Spurs and I think on another day with maybe a right back who's a little bit weaker son could get even more chances down to the by line cutting it back across maybe getting an assist maybe even just going for goal himself and so I kind of back him in this game against Everton they're not the worst defense in the world we'll see that in a minute when we discuss the captaincy we've got some stats for some of the fixtures to Target this week but I had a bit of funs left over and thought I'd go for him didn't have that extra space for Kevin De bruyne as I've gone for Bernardo Silva Instead at 6.5 million now he's not going to be a long-term pick really gundan signing back now is another competition for that Manchester City Midfield spot but Bernardo Silva looked pretty good against Chelsea in my eyes 6.5 million feeding Harland getting a few chances here and there I think for him 6.5 million it was either him or dku and I've just taken a punt on Bernardo cuz I can't stand watching dcu's end product all in all uh so then we've got a and Salah as the final two midfielders and harand taking the captains down B obviously and mice up front the bench just full of absolute jobbers and bench fter but we'll discuss the captaincy now erling Harland is the best Captain for this week probably is he worth the triple Captain's arm band that's a different question maybe we need to [Music] answer so the data isn't really in so far for this season you can't really include too much on expected goals conceded so we've used for the captaincy Matrix this week the data for brenford and Everton from last season uh IP switch if you're wondering against Liverpool had an expected goals conceded over the 90 minutes of 3.11 so in that game you could say Liverpool and Man City are very similar levels of attack therefore you could arguably argue that that kind of number is comparable for this fixture against Man City uh for IP switch so it's very hard to go off the back of 90 minutes that's why we're not using those numbers for game week one for brenford and Everton were using their numbers from last season and kind of taking the fact that their defense hasn't changed overly dramatically but the top row suggests that the predicted points go massively in favor of earling Harland uh 9.4 is one of the highest you'll ever see in a single game we with Salah on 6.9 and sun down on 4.9 not sure how much that game we one low score is taken into account there so yeah out of Everton and brenford is pretty close but IP switch we don't have too much to go on they were one of the best defenses in the Championships last season but often that isn't saying an awful lot at all in the step up as we know is a very very big one to the Premier League uh sides wise Liverpool are the best attack 2.40 expected goals uh per 90 last season for them Man City not too far behind and then even bigger gap down to Spurs on 1.8 per 90 and Muhammad Salah leads the way on an expected FPL individual note per player and Harland on 7.7 expected FPL points per 90 and this is all taken from the opats tool over on the fantasy football fix website if you want to check that out so our I switch worth targeting with your triple Captain's armband I think the discussion around that is mainly due to the fact that this season we will have fewer double game weeks it looks like we'll have two kind of as a base and as well as that we've got an extra chip so not only if you got a triple Captain you got a bench boost you want to use in in a double game week you've got a free hit you're probably going to want to use in a double game week and then you've also got that mystery chip which we don't know what it is yet but chips often go hand inand with targeting big game weeks etc etc so if you are going to end up using your triple captain on a single game we player the argument is there isn't really a stronger option to Target than Harland at home against ipswitch a team that are new to the Premier League maybe haven't had as much time to adapt yet but the counter argument to that is they're of course new to the Premier League with a high attitude hopefully that result against Liverpool for them won't hurt them too much they might go to the EAD try and shut up shop and maybe do a good job putting two or three players Mark earning Harland in this fixture so it could really go one one or two ways it could even go could obviously go a multitude of ways Harland could get a blank he could get one goal he could come away with a hat-trick and you got to make that call yourself go with your gut feeling is my advice here don't just not do it because you're scared or because you're worried other people aren't doing it just make your own decision uh based on your own intuition what you've seen so far from the football the stats if you want to take those into account uh but yeah in my view there is a quite a strong case for going for it and I quite like just having a bit of fun at the start of the season when often uh it's pretty boring with no one using any of their chips I think it's nice to see someone doing it a little bit different and why not lead the way and do that yourself obviously if it goes badly then you'll be a bit down in the dumps and be a bit stinky but it's FPL at the end of the day it's only a game why not have some fun but yeah after that lesson hopefully you are impressed uh with what I've presented so far today the algorithm and my own teams I'm hoping I'll be more impressed at the end of the game week with my score than the AI teams let me know Down Below in the comments which team you think will score higher for this game week and with that I wish you guys the best of luck uh for game week 2 may your arrows be green and I'll see you in the next one goodbye [Music],3247
11,fantasyfootballfixYT,pcQvJN43yls,"♻️ QUANSAH OUT, LEWIS IN? | TOP Fantasy Premier League 24/25 Tips &amp; FPL GAMEWEEK 2 Guide",2024-08-21T13:45:08Z,yes guys welcome back to another fancy football fix YouTube video my name is fpo naturo and in today's video we are looking at the top transfers going into gameweek 2 with concerns with the likes of in kungu and quansa we're going to be looking at the best Replacements as well as just generally the best players to buy so as always if you're new around here make sure you do smash the Subscribe button and of course drop a like on the video if you are looking forward to it without further Ado let's get into today's video [Music] so first up I think it is really really important here to take a look at this Liverpool attack coming off the back of a two-nil victory against IPS which it wasn't all playing sailing in the first half but AR slot made the necessary changes in the game to get them over the line and that definitely was influenced with jot Diaz and mosala a combined exg of the three of over two which is really really promising and it makes us start to think do we need two of these attackers not just the one cuz I do feel like a lot of people that are watching this right now probably already have one of jot Diaz or Moos Sala and when we look at the underline numbers here we need to first and foremost say that it's only one game week worth of information so we can't draw up any conclusions right now and say to ourselves this particular player is the best player for our teams especially with the not the information that we're looking at right now because Diaz was the one that came away with the game with a blank but his underlying numbers were actually the best 0.91 expected goal is fantastic comparing that to Dio's 0.81 and mosala 0.68 let's be real all three of these are brilliant underlying numbers but you can see how Lis Diaz owners are really really unlucky in gameweek one and in terms of expected assists Lis Diaz leading the way as well 0.54 compared to Mo salz .45 nothing for Di but I've spoken about this in previous videos when I'm buying the number number n in a team I don't really care about his expected assists it's all about is he getting the big chances is he the one everything is funneling through and you can see here J's underline numbers for expected goals was decent so no problems there with jot but Diaz owners you are incredibly unlucky and the shot volume for all three also great four for Salah three a piece for Diaz and Dogo J so what we can conclude right now and what we've seen so far is that all three of these are Fant fantastic FPL options all of them are at some point going to be a slight risk of minutes I think in particular jot and leis Diaz because we also have gakpo and Darwin Nunes waiting in the wings I think Mo Sal space in this team is probably a bit more secure as it always is under Jurgen klopp's tenure I think the same will apply to Arie slot it is the most experienced forward and I do expect him just to play the majority of minutes but right now with the fixtures coming up brenford at home man united away not Forest at home Bournemouth at home I feel like doubling up on the Liverpool attack is actually a viable strategy for your FPL teams and you can even do it as quickly as this game week so if you have Mo Sala right now and you're in a position where maybe you have in kungu a bit of money in the bank and you think to yourself I'm done with in kungu then maybe going to someone like aot or Diaz is the route to go for even though Diaz had the better numbers I still personally would lead towards di G I just prefer him as a finisher and I do think that even though he will have worser numbers at times I still expect him to actually have the output and that is the most important thing underlying numbers are great and they are an actual predictor of the future but I also take into account finishing and Diego just has that clinical nature about that maybe Lis Diaz doesn't have so I think doubling up on the attack is absolutely viable for your FPL teams in terms of FPL points expected you can see mosala led the way Diaz followed by Dogo AO so to conclude I think right now whichever Liverpool asset you have you stick if you have Diaz and blank do not worry about it it was still a fantastic game for him the big question is do you double up if you have the luxury to do so I would but if you're in a position right now your team looks great I wouldn't be rushing to get another Liverpool attacker in keep the one you have reassess and then when we have our free transfers available or the wild card we really then especially in game week four need to consider a double up on on these Liverpool midfielders so I briefly mentioned about in kunu in the situation that we have right now with him so just to give people an update with in kunu came off before the 60th minute in game week one against Man City underly numbers were not fantastic and with Chelsea right now recruiting more and more players as each day passes we have xia Felix now bought by Chelsea we got Pedro Netto signed there are slight concerns about inu's game time in the future for game week two game week three and onwards and I do understand the problem that managers are currently having right now with that I think we been kungu in pre season he was such um an important player for Chelsea getting significant minutes but with Chelsea's scad changing each and every day there are concerns that he might be a 60-minute man I don't think his starts are going to be hindered massively I think he's not going to maintain himself as a 90-minute man now I have to put out there and say Chelsea have a fixture this Thursday in the conference League leg one of two so we need to make sure we don't make any transfers right now for in kunu because if he's benched in that game I think that's a positive that he will play in gameweek two and to be honest with you if that is the case do not be selling in kungu going into gameweek two however if we do get in a position where in kungu looks like he could be a rotation risk going into the weekend then I do think we need to at least consider some alternatives for our teams and at the same price I think these three are viable options doku and Man City Brighton's matoma and man United's garnacho so of course very very differing minutes for all three of these assets here Duku playing the predominant of the game in gameweek one matoma similar Garra only playing 25 minutes in gameweek 1 so we do need to account for that in terms of XG matomo with a massive 1.21 however his goal did come from for a very high XG chat so he did have other things in the game his shot volume at four was great but his goal that he scored was a very high XG chance in itself so that has dominated the numbers quite a bit garnacho 0.5 XG obviously missed that huge chance but in 25 minutes played really promising numbers and of course dku 0.13 XG in that game in terms of FP points matoma the real winner here but my eyes are on garnacho right now because we knew his preseason was a little bit hit and miss with minutes he was going to be building up his Fitness in the early stages of the season but I think garnacho is so important to this man united team and I really don't see him as a rotating squad player I think we're looking at ten Haag viewing garnacho as a starter in this man united team and I think it's only a matter of time until either displaces rashford off the left or he comes in fulltime as the right winger taking minutes away from Amma Dio and right now if I was looking at a long-term option for my team I would be quite inclined to go for someone like a garat at 6.5 million away followed by Liverpool at home which I don't think is a terrible fixture for attackers then sath Hampton away followed by Palace away I get it I think managers probably want to see maybe a little bit more from garnacho from a minute's perspective before investing in him but he needs to be on your radar dku on the other hand a player that I cannot get behind investing long term however if you're maybe looking at a ward in game week four and you are completely committed to that strategy and I do think doku for the next two is actually an okay move it switch at home in gameweek two fantastic fixture and we know dku is one of those players that does have a really high ceiling where he can deliver in those games with some monster Halles then West Ham away after that fixture start to skew a little bit and also I think the game time of dku becomes so unpredictable so I think dku for one game week is great finally matoma now matoma I think has gone massively under the radar and I really do think he needs to be acceleration for our teams the only concern that I do have about Moma is that M 5.5 million is actually amazing FPL value and should we go for matoma when we get Mina at a million less now I do think mata's minutes are going to be the best of all Brighton assets he's much more of the senior in that attack right now and I do think that he is just Irreplaceable on that left hand side as opposed to Someone Like A Mina who could can come off for an A dingra so I think Boma isn't a buy right now maybe consideration around R game week four with those brilliant two fixtures against ipswitch and nost of forest so to conclude in terms of the predicted points for the next five matoma does lead the way and I do think that kind of plays Into The Narrative of maybe avoiding the next two because that's where his predicted points are really low and then buying him in game week four gyu is at 16.1 is actually my preference over both of these at the time we're recording but to be honest with in kungu unless he plays a lot of minutes on Thursday I think you hold on to him for at least one more game we and then we can reassess when the fixtures get better for these players and maybe a consideration for gameweek three or four in our FPL teams so last step of The Replacements I need to talk about these 4.5 million Defenders who are potential alternatives for jarro Quanza now the big problem right now of course is that jarro Quan's price fell last night to 4.4 million so I really do hope that you did monitor to the price as always make sure you do check out fantasy footballfix.com link is in the bio for the price change predictor our algorithm predicts when the prices are going to change really important to have that in these opening stages so you check it out download on the app or check it out on the website link in the bio but of course 4.4 million for Quant set is a major concern because now you can only go down to a 4 million if you don't have money in the bank but let's say you have money in the bank fingers crossed these are the three considerations that we can have for our teams Rico Lewis Robinson at Fulham and man United's mazari so Lewis in particular is the one that's catching a lot of people's attention right now brilliant game against Chelsea 12 final third passes which is brilliant against Chelsea bonus Baseline not as good as I thought at 22 but still not too bad at all and in terms of Rico Lewis I think we all know he's a phenomenal option if we can get a man city defender of 4.5 million everybody would own him the problem with it is can we guarantee those minutes and I think that's always the concern with Rico Lewis especially when we know KL Walker waiting in the wings an experienced Pro that pep does lean on at times but I think eventually Walker's time is going to come to an end and we know pep tries to always evolve This Man City team and maybe it is time for him to actually evolve that right back role and bring in Rico Lewis who's been knocking on the door for the last 12 months or so so first thing I want to say predicted points Rico Lewis is actually leading the way at 20.7 but I would say also his minutes are the most unpredictable of all the players I think it comes down to this if you're looking at an early wild card I really think taking the punto Rico Lewis is worth it at home gets IP switch Follow by West Ham and then brenford at home knowing that if he eventually loses his place you can wild card and you already had that planned if you're maybe looking at a wild card around gameweek eight then I think to myself maybe Lewis is a bit too much of a risk if you bring him in plays gameweek two and then is benched for gameweek three onwards then you have really broughten a player that is just as much of a concern as Jared quaner but I do think he is a fantastic option now Robinson for me is the complete package has the fixtures underly numbers last season were good not incredible but I think he is an attacking out Outfield player and importantly we know that he is going to have guaranteed game time in that Fulham team so great fixtures decent attack and output and guaranteed minutes for him I think he's a fantastic alternative to jarro Quan in your teams and for the foreseeable future Leicester at home IP switch away West Ham at home this is a player that can come straight into your teams and he can feature week in week out so I love Robinson probably my number one pick of all The Replacements there lastly mazari now I've brought him in because I don't actually love the pick but he is one of the most bought players going into gameweek 2 and personally I don't see it right now Brighton away not an ideal fixture at all followed by Liverpool at home again quite a tricky fixture for mazari from a clean sheet perspective and that's the first thing you want to look at can my Defender deliver clean sheets then can he deliver output and I didn't see enough from mazari to think that this guy is going to be getting tons of assists maybe the Trent 2.0 I don't really see that right now so even though the numbers are good the Baseline BS is good final third pass is at 10 personally I prefer Lewis as a short-term pun or Robinson as a long-term punt maai would actually be my third pick on this list but let me know your thoughts in the comments section so finally I thought it' be really important to take a look at the predicted points for gameweek 2 because we need to talk about Captain C because there seems like there's only one man right now and that is going to be erling hland at 10.1 predicted points which is absolutely monstrous and I think the big conversation point also is do we triple captain earling hland 10.1 predicted points is probably some of the highest you are going to see in a single game week and I think that's the big thing right now if you are a manager that is all about double game weeks and it's worth noting this season will be the least double game weeks we have ever had because of the way that they've change the cup structures now of course freak things can happen we've seen it in the last few years which will instigate some double game weeks but right now based on what we know single game weeks might actually be a viable move for your triple captain and I think IP switch at home probably is one of the best that you can go for so I know it feels a bit scary doing it in gameweek 2 but I think you do actually have a little bit of a thought about whether you triple Captain Howland for me I think it's the best game week to do it in a single game week it's just more about whether you want to save that chip later on in the season I probably won't do it but I think anybody who does it rightly so has an argument to do so so Howland by far on away the best captaincy outside of that de bruyne at 7.6 pred points then mosal at 6 6.9 very difficult for managers that don't have Harland to say to themselves Salah is a better Captain see but let's be real brenford at home is not a bad fixture at all and would I be shocked if Mo Salah outscores Highland I wouldn't be personally so I think Mo Salah is absolutely fine as an alternative Captain for earling hland outside of that Phil Fen at 6.5 a player that I need to see minutes before actually considering in our teams then a really unlucky not to get any returns but with Man City now going for gundan in the transfer market I think e is pretty safe in that Crystal Palace team going forward and now becomes a brilliant option for your FPL teams followed by Edison isach Trent son and sacka so to conclude the predicted points personally howand by far away the best captaincy and a triple Captain consideration but you shouldn't be scared going for mosala as an alternative and let me know in the comments if you're planning on going for a triple Captain Highland so that is going to wrap up today's top transfers going into game week two if you have any questions please do put them in the comment section and as always if you enjoyed the video make sure to drop a like and of course smash the Subscribe button and I will see you in the

the fantasy footballfix.com YouTube channel with me Tom caml you can find me on X utterly TC and in this week's video guys we're going to actually be looking at some FPL points because game week one is all but in the books we got Corey joining us from America he's going to talk through his gameweek one scenario so far we're going to look ahead to gameweek two some early statistics as well so without further Ado guys let's get right into it guys welcome back to the channnel and I hope your game week one has gone or is going super well depending on when you're watching the video we are recording on Sunday night and Corey it's been a long time man welcome back to the channel how are you I'm doing well thank you good it good to have you back on the channel Corey I think we've got on screen at the moment kind of mean to have your overall rank up here when game week one is not even in the books we don't tend to pay too much attention to that so forget about that guys it's all good we can look Instead at Cory's amazing finishes over the course of his time playing at FPL with a top 1K finish multiple top 5K finishes top 10K finishes of course so Corey let's get some quick thoughts on from yourself around the game changers before we get into the nitty-gritty of game week one I asked the other guys who've been on the channel so far we've got these rule changes in terms of being able to ACR five transfers we got some BPS uh revisions good for the game bad for the game indifferent what are your your thoughts on the game changers yeah I definitely think the transfer uh change is is is good it gives you more options um you know we've the last couple years especially the templates have been very very strong pricing has been way too lenient um and it's just kind of felt like everyone was doing the same and at least this offers some differentiation add in the much more reasonable pricing this year and it feels like we're you know there's still going to be a template there always is but it's not going to be nearly as strong as it was the last couple years hopefully yeah and like all the other guys I've talked to um in the preseason Cory shared those thoughts as well from yourself in terms of how you manage do you see yourself being a the type of manager who's going to be able to take advantage of racking up multiple free transfers or do you think actually that's not going to be something that you're going to see and you'll still be pretty much firing at will on the on the free transfers what how do you see it going well if I have game weeks that are in the six millions like this one's going to be probably not um I will uh I will say that I actually thought about the extra free transfers in one of my decisions I made uh for game week one so it was in the back of my mind and so I I do think there's going to be a time when you've got a good team you've got things pretty much settled and in the past you might have done a transfer that had a marginal benefit because otherwise you're going to lose it and now I think you'll have to justify those a little more so it'll be interesting to see how it plays out yeah um obviously we don't know it's same with the bonus points right we we don't really know what's going to happen until we start seeing some data um and and and see how it all plays out yeah and that's a nice segue actually guys so in this week's video actually we're going to take a look at some early statistics and obviously it's super early on in the season with gameweek one not having yet completed but just to give you guys an indication in terms of the type of metrics that we'll be presenting in these videos ongoing throughout the course of the season so that's going to be an interesting kind of Peak at what that underlying data will look like as we begin to progress through the season and I should say at this moment as well guys if you haven't already then do head over to fancy footballfix.com subscribe over there as well and you will be able to enable push notifications and see how our Elite managers decide to Tinker with their teams going into gameweek two and onwards throughout the the course of the rest of the season Cory I don't think we want to belor this one the guys are here to see what team you put together for game week 1 and I'm sure you're super excited to tell us how it has gone so far so let's get in to your game we one point so far okay guys so I'm just going to give you a chance to familiarize yourself with that screen on the right hand side then and you're going to see some names who I'm sure were pretty popular in the preseason uh musings that we were all going through I'm going to start with the zero point of the bagel Cory I'm going to have to ask you about Barco how unlucky did you get with Barco and did other FBI managers of which there will be many who opted for Barco off the strength of a great preseason is this just down to Pure bad luck yeah I mean what what can you do right it was uh he Not only was he very good in the preseason but if you looked on the Brighton fan forums he was in almost everyone's projected lineup yeah um so was very you you knew there was a chance but it it seemed fairly strong that he would start in gameweek one um it wasn't necessarily the easiest fixture but then Everton just looked awful did didn't and played what what what 30 minutes or so with with 10 men so um yeah I I think you have to consider yourself fairly unlucky uh if you've gone Baro he was never going to be likely someone you kept forever but he was certainly an enabler at the beginning as you as as things kind of settled themselves out and you start to get a better lay of the land so um definitely unfortunate for me and and thousands of others many other people yeah definitely I completely concur with that off the strength of such a good preseason you're right like Everton were horrific weren't they it's what happens when you start Ashley Young in in 2024 you can't expect to take Liberties like that and get away with it can you so the rest of the defense that I did want to ask you Cory you and I haven't prepared sort of questions off the back for this but seeing your defense there it was quite interesting to me to see how you didn't put a great amount of money into the defense and a lot of the folks that I talked to in preseason and around the I guess the the FPL community at large were talking around spending big at the back trying not to put I guess gameweek one results into it Corey and you know it's wonderful with hindsight but what we s thinking there to kind of avoid plowing money into the defense and looking further a field is that something strategically that is consistent with what you've always done or just for this season I I think it was just the combination of pricing um and fixtures so obviously Arsenal even with the price changes still seems to be the best route to to clean sheets but their fixtures are pretty rough after after gameweek one they they they really have four um I think it's four all four it it the Ty of sacrifices that had to had to make elsewhere were were challenging to go that route um Alexander Arnold is an amazing asset but he's also seven right and and and Liverpool's defense isn't exactly foolproof um I thought if switch had multiple chances to to craft something together the final bow a lot of times let them down but I I just don't necessarily know that he's going to be worth it maybe he is he's certainly um going to be attacking um but again there it's it was it was tough so I think the combination there and you look at City whose fixtures are kind of up and down and then they have seven Defenders or whatever who are going to play a lot so I know a lot of people went I don't know that I think he's worth that money his role is I mean today seemed kind of what it was at the beginning last year um and he's got competition so it for me it was just a u a calculated gamble add in the the lack of clean sheets last year and and that's the route I went so yeah if things have kind of gone back into more clean sheets like they they have been then then I certainly re reevaluate but that that's the route I went and quite frankly my defense didn't do that badly other if farco would have played um and gotten a clean sheet let's say I mean I would have had 15 points from three Defenders I'd have been just fine so it it it it didn't really hurt me so bad there no it was other parts that really really stuck me yeah and yeah that exactly it wasn't so much about the result it was more around the kind of thinking that went into it really interesting to see your rationale there and and I guess Trent Alexander Arnold can return in any any fixture can't he but I guess strategically as well Liverpool defensively there was and remains a question mark as to how they're going to perform under a you know new manager with slightly different ideas so the jury I guess is still out on them but Trent I think universally accepted as a is a good asset he's just cost a lot of money as a consequence of that let's look further um up field then so we've got the Midfield four then you opted for mosala in there along with earling Harland as well obviously that comes with the need by which to balance the book somehow right so let's talk around Rogers and unu first of all um Corey your thoughts on those two picks pre-season and also how did you see how they performed in their respective fixtures over game week one does it give you pause ahead of game weeks 2 and Beyond or are you pretty comfortable with them looking forward over the next few game weeks so I mean the hype around Rogers uh is is substantial um within within the vill community again if you go to their fan boards it's the they're all pretty pretty excited about him he played pretty well down the stretch and uh he brings a unique skill set that they don't really have um and so at his price point I think he's a great gamble if it doesn't work out you're you're spending five five million it's not not a big deal um in kungu I Chelsea's a mess like they are just a mess um if they play him at the wing like he did today there he's he's worthless he just does not he's not a Winger he doesn't really function well there um he can play as a second Striker he can play as a 10 but he's got to be more Central for to be effective so uh obviously they were playing city today you didn't really expect too much um I did think they had a couple scenarios where they were in Fairly good positions but uh Enzo Fernandez and Jackson were just I mean Jackson was Jackson um but Enzo Fernandez was just terrible so um we'll see how that goes obviously him getting hooked before 60 is a problem um and they have approximately 30 players right so uh it could be it could be an issue pretty quickly but for now I think uh give them a give them another game see how they up and and go from there it does feel like that it the word chaos was used in one of the reports I read uh following the game in terms of squad selection team selection performance you've you've talked about individual roles there as well and it does feel like you might strike lightning in a bottle with one of these guys like and kungu Co Palmer I'm sure there's other people in the in the frame as well but it does feel like that how did you put it there a mess so okay that's the analysis so B bad it's so bad and that Midfield Trio is not going to work ever it's just not like Fernandez is not a 10 he he he showed that last year when they tried to play him there he just doesn't function well you know if you're four I mean they're basically four2 31 today and I mean he's not who you need in the center so you saying Chelsea full stop or a stay away Corey like and kungu everybody else at this stage it's it's not worth I yeah I I think I wouldn't be buying into them and until you get some more information and they start looking better um but again at the beginning last year they were kind of all over the place and then the last half of the season they were great I can't I was shocked as they fire poino yeah and then um but now it seems like they're back to the drawing board and trying to integrate a bunch of new players and new new roles and it's just it just doesn't seem like it's working integrating new again they were playing they were playing Man City so and so what do you want to do it's is a tough gig isn't it and integrating new players that's what they do at Chelsea so let's see how they how they work that one out over game weeks two and Beyond so let's look at the more premium options in your Midfield here Cory you went with mosala straight back to the usual that we're used to in game one and everything else you just you thought he was a kind of no-brainer even at 12.5 and presumably you're feeling pretty pretty um comfortable that he's going to be a a long-term stay on the team well I mean the the thing with is Liverpool's asset or fixtures are great oh he had no comp he had no competition in the summer he's fully rusted fully healthy he's obviously in amazing Fitness he's he's a he's a piece of iron right so oh yeah um he and Holland both having no summer competition really pushed me to just have them as as the the stalwarts in the team um so I I would be very shocked if if I have both of them come gameweek six I think is when arsenals fixtures turn um that would be I see a solid assaka probably but there's other options too right yeah um because I think long term it's just too much money but at the beginning with so much uncertainty I went that way um the annoying part is I had the armband on Sala until um two hours before the game uh the deadline and the thought process there was it was very very close between him and isach and the effective ownership on I'd say uh Advanced teams like people were really committed or such that esack was GNA be over 100% And then I'd be rooting against my own player which I just hate doing so uh that turned out really poorly given the red card of Newcastle but uh I'm definitely for now salid is gon to be there until we until we get some fixture changes and and fix fixture swings elsewhere I wasn't going to bring up the Late Captain change but since you did let's talk around it because I had to actually ask our our graphic designer Finn to actually change this cuz he still had the ccy on the mo and I was like oh dude you're going to you're going to piss Cory off if so unfortunately not so um yeah I get it it was super close and look game week one promoted team Salah Halls it's no shock there is it let not belor that one too much I mean you talked around sort of bad luck around there um let sort of extend or bleeds into e what a performance right could have got so many more points than he did what a player right Cory FPL wise as well as as real life performance he's he's he's outstanding isn't he yeah he's uh I thought Palace um looked very very good now their their structure does for counters uh Munoz Munoz gets so far forward like he plays like a Winger uh I he's a great value of five um I mean just working Fitness which is why he came out because um uh he's a much better player than Edward and so I think if he's out for a while or whatever that would that would be some issues but they look really they look well put together now we'll see if everyone sticks around but if they do I think team's going to be uh be very good yeah I concur so you'd say a Muno they're the standouts right in terms of the Crystal Palace FPL selections both nice prices and in the defensive Midfield respectively looking ahead to the forwards Cory I think we we probably don't need to talk around isach and Harland in too much details as they felt fairly ubiquitous in in the conversations I was having preseason and and talking to the other other guys on on fix Etc but you managed to squeeze olle Watkins in obviously with harand and Salah both in the team money is is tight once you do that right but you found a spot for Watkins talk to me around that because he played no minutes in preseason right you already had Rogers there as well if you're just a a believer that olle Watkins is underpriced do you think this is a long-term gig is it the fixtures what was it that made you invest that that chunk of change in in ollywood Watkins yeah um and I really wanted Watkins there was no reason to think he was injured um he was in training he just hadn't featured um but neither had you know several other players Cole pal Palmer fod and those kind of guys right or Palmer might have got in a few minutes um so I I it wasn't I wasn't too worried once it was clearly was in training and he was in full training so um he did look very sluggish which not necessarily surprising but um the whole thing around this was I don't know how I like I don't know the plan on get back in in gameweek three if I wouldn't have gone with him in gameweek one I see I it was really I really really went back and forth on this a lot between three options one was just going sanky and having some money in the bank the and then the third was going um I think it was going to be wood uh which you know would have worked out great but going wood and then moving Smith row to Gordon um so that was one that was where my team was for a very long time until till the end so yeah it's really I never really expected gameweek one to go that well and I honestly don't expect game week two to be that great but I'm hoping I mean I'm hoping I'm not too far back so when game week three hits I'm in a very good position to take advantage of those fixture changes and hopefully I'll have three fix uh three transfers to play around with yeah should do right I mean there's nothing catastrophic here injury-wise is there from from what I've seen so far I know we've got another game to play on on on Monday night as well but um you know we'll see the problem the problem is I'm going to be 7 million so that's the problem is I got a big demon I got I got to build out of so I know it's h you're you're back of the field ready to ready to make a a charge through but yeah there's more than 37 game weeks to go with still a game week in a game a fixture in game week one as well so time to chill I'm sure let's talk around that bench just quickly Cory before we move on and talk some stats and your plans ahead of game week two as well so Smith row there sitting there with three points obviously Fulham got got beaten at Old Trafford as well mikeno and cont you went three play playing substitutes there I guess with with with Barco being the make weight MoneyWise as well looking at that bench Cory anything that you would you would think you'd be looking to to Walter are you happy with that I mean Smith row got the start didn't he and Fulham have a lovely fixture run don't they ahead of or from game week two onwards yeah yeah I I I think uh Smith both Smith and Rogers were value plays right and if you hit um they could be great Smith Rose seems like he's going to be core to their team um obviously that he's he's never had much Fitness so there's you're gonna have to be concerned about that yeah um but with both Holland and Salo there's just no money all in solid Watkins there's just no money to spin so uh you gotta go cheap I think they were both of value uh mlink on Kana I I mean again everon were terrible but we'll see how that goes Ka that's more for Villa their fixures from three to nine uh I don't think they're great defensively but he's 4.5 and he's going to play every game so yeah yeah that they're fine aren't they the champions league has not yet started for them and seems Seems a secure pick and you do wonder if Everton will improve if they retain Jared branth weight and are able to to get him back on the pitch soon as well so you know we'll see there as well all right cool let's not focus too much on gameweek one it's game week one guys right so if you've had a have had a week that you're not happy with don't worry about it there're are 37 to put things right and Cory's got big plans for gameweek three so stay tuned for that to see how that works out but guys we're going to move on now take a little look at some of the early outstanding performers from gameweek one some stats around that to give you an insight as to how this series is going to play out throughout the rest of the course of the season and get Corey's thoughts on transfer plans for game week two as well okay guys so we can see here we've got we've pulled out some statistics from game week one obviously right now don't really have Trend uh data available with the gameweek one not having yet completed but this is what we're going to be showing you guys ongoing in this series some some stats that we think are relevant here with expected goals points expected assists shots shots on targets and some live stats as well for managers who are competing as well along with our games that're already in the books as well so Corey I think first of all is there anyone standing out from a statistic perspective here who you're particularly interested in uh I would not I don't think so nothing was really that surprising um it kind of went as expected I I thought uh the for Chelsea uh certainly again and we spoke with them they were a mess but I their structure was a little different and unexpected but yeah the big teams they kind of went as as I thought they would um you know it it kind of played out obviously we're incorporating the players from the summer coming back so we'll see how how foden uh if his roles changed at all they you know they've got multiple Wingers uh that they brought in and so uh but for game week one it was as expected um yeah you know it's just about whether or not the underlyings resulted in points so I mean if if I'm looking at this screen here if we go through through one by one through people who stood out potentially you're seeing Thomas such there in expected goals over one I'm a West Ham fan that's not something you should pay much attention to guys I I'm the host but I can give you that for free in terms of other ones who who may be of more interest here Corey we've got matoma who featured in many people's thoughts last season as well Brighton were not part of the the Discord really preseason as well but looking at that Brighton team we can see M featuring and expected assists as well do you think Brighton were overlooked a little bit do you think there's anyone who's now of Interest particularly if you are looking for sort of budget enablers are you thinking that they could be a viable option particularly when those fixtures improve in in a couple of game weeks time I I I think if you get uh some nailed on Brighton assets they'll absolutely be there the challenge is they have so many they're they're like they're like they're like what Chelsea should do I guess but they have so many options I know and leave him there he was he was phenomenal in some parts last year so um matoma seems like he's probably pretty nailed and and without Europe this year he feels like he could be uh a pretty solid pretty solid selection but the rest of them if you tell me who's going to start I'll tell you if they're if they're worth it because problem they have a lot of potential yeah yeah they they really do and and looking at the rest of the data here that we've got shots on target I think is an interesting one to see you know people the the the premium options of mosalah and sacka of course ones we talked around as well but Bruno Fernandez seems to have been a a pick that where in some folks as teams as well and and they owners can feel pretty unlucky right in terms of how how he performed in in game one 8.5 million do you think there's a a scenario that you're going to find yourself needing to find a route for Brun Fernandez into the team Cory do you trust this man united team in any way shape or form no I don't trust man united but um he's you know he's he's been very very good as an FPL asset every season even the last couple when he's kind of dropped his underlying data has been great it's just you know they've struggled so um I I think fundamentally that the challenge with man united right now is they don't have anyone to score um if they can get someone who can finish chances like you know when rashford got hot two seasons ago um Bruno becomes an excellent asset so um but he'll definitely be on my radar at 8.5 certainly not cheap but it's also not prohibitively expensive no um it feels like he'll he'll have better underlying data than someone like odard it's just odard plays in a better team with better teammates and and and thus he might end up with more points yeah um but he's he's his underlines have always been great so I definitely suspect he'll be on my team at some point yeah I get it and that point around the forward as well do you think when Rasmus hland returns which is not meant to be that far away particularly with an early International break do you think that's the point at which we become more interested in in Bruno Fernandez or do you think there's still fair amount of work to do for us to trust that Rasmus hland is the answer for the striker spot for Man United as well yeah I don't know that I trust him um at this point we have we have to see some evidence that he is uh he's the answer um it feels like uh you know it feels like someone like Tony um and I'm not I'm not big on recruiting someone of that you know 28 or what is he 28 29 um but it feels like as a stop Gap measure if someone like that there would be really uh really uh changing for that team so we'll see we'll see what happens there's a long way to go in the transfer window still a couple certainly not c a huge oil fan at the no still a couple of weeks guys to for clubs to make transfers as well which could of course massively change the FPL landscape Cory I got to ask you obviously super early on in the season the plan is to recr transfers is that what you're looking to do ahead of gameweek two roll in with the same same bunch of guys we had on the previous slide for game week two no transfers yeah there's no reason to kneejerk um you know it Let It Go gameweek two honestly probably gameweek three unless we start seeing some injuries or if we you know farco is bitched to get or Inu is pulled or doesn't start then maybe you start reconsidering um but there's it's way too early these teams aren't at all settled um we won't really have a good feeling for for how things are shaking out until the end of the transfer window everyone's healthy and got re reintegrated to the team then we'll have a better understanding of of of who the who the options are and where to put uh where to put our Focus yeah understood yeah I completely agree with that and you know you you and everyone else who plan their teams over the course of the preseason did so to to look more than just beyond or rather more than just that gameweek one so it might be just wise to to take a CH and wait and see how things play out which is I'm sure what you're you're going to do Cory it's been great to talk to you again my friend it's great to have you back on we're going to C check out how your season goes throughout the course of the rest of the campaign anything else that you want us to get across to the guys before we wrap things up no I just uh I think in general this season has felt uh I a lot I felt more uncertain about this season than than any in a while I think some of that is due to the prices which are are much more aggressive and I very happy about that yeah me too um but I think that you know the the length of the European and well not just European but the link of the international competitions in the summer really are impacting uh and will impact for for a few more weeks the the team setups and those kinds of things so don't worry too much about how things are going things are going to change and and you'll be able to recover yeah I like it a good good word of um reassurance to to end on Corey thanks so much for coming on and guys if you did lose the visual of Corey on the last slide then apologies for those technical difficulties we've had but hopefully the audio has remained consistent uh throughout and we'll get that sorted for next week guys so I will say thank you to Corey for coming on to the channel again for this season guys do please smash a like on the video leave a comment down below if you've got any thoughts on game week 1 at all ahead of game week 2 look forward to talking to you all next week I hope game week one went great for all of you and I'll talk to you all then take care bye-bye [Music],5679
13,fantasyfootballfixYT,jUlug2HTj8Q,🤖 AI FPL BEST TEAM REVEAL &amp; Top Captain Picks | Fantasy Premier League 24/25 Tips &amp; GAMEWEEK 1 Guide,2024-08-16T09:00:44Z,hello everybody we're back it's fantasy football fix here with another season of Eddie versus the algorithm the series where once more of the 2425 season this time I'll be taking on the algorithm computer generated highest predicted Point scoring team for each of the 38 game weeks of the season so a free hit team if you will basically I'm putting up my own onewe draft up against it we see who can score more points in each game week last season it was a pretty convincing win over the algorithm the season before that very very very close indeed so I'm hoping for more of the latter uh maybe this year we'll have a tougher race but yeah first week let's get into it and kick things off by seeing how the computer generated team is looking and who the highest predicted Point scoring players for your gameweek one teams [Music] are so a very warm welcome back to any of you who are tuning into the series once again if you're new around here hopefully that explan did make sense feel free to consider subscribing as well if you want to see more of this hopefully you enjoy your first viewing of the series but yeah as usual we'll be revealing the algorithm team first running through it discussing the picks then we'll have a look at my team and we'll also take a look at the captaincy so we'll tend to do this weekly and compare some of the top captaincy options and there is a fair bit of discussion around the captaincy for this game week across the course of the Season there'll be game weeks where there's more options fewer options I think it's pretty interesting for game week one so let's see what all the data is suggesting if you want to check out any of the tools that we used for this video then make sure to check out the links in the description you can take them over to Fantasy Football fix where there's some great offers on before game week one so get in now I use it all the time for my Opa stats tools uh and doing all the research around my FPL assets but enough of that let's get into the team and kicking off with the goalkeeper and it's going to be a long-term algorithm favorite that is Jordan pford a home fixture against Brighton isn't you say is the easiest on paper they look like a very strong attacking side they've signed some more Firepower in this window Mina have 35 million euro I believe it was looks very impressive from final they brought in bruer from mines today as well they've obviously got Xiao Pedro wellbe a lot of their attackers eventually gaining Fitness they've still got players like in season to come back but Brighton look like a very good attacking force and Everton was just a very renowned defense last season and I think that data will be feeding into a lot of the algorithm decision making and you know why shouldn't it pford I think has been put off by a lot of people cuz he's not that traditional 4.5 that people like to start the season with he's now priced at 5 million but I still think he's definitely worth a thinking about and could be one of those Keepers that just just continue to be part of the solid defense and so if Everton continue in their ways and continue their form from last season then he could be a great option and he does have a home fixture this week which is more than can be said for some of the other goalkeepers with kind fixtures so yeah a decent choice in the algorithm there in goal I'm actually quite impressed by that in defense we're going to see some home fixtures come into things so Gabrielle is the Arsenal Defender for the algorithms picked he's going with Trent alander Arnold as well and then burn as the final of the three at the back so yeah again impressed with these picks I think the Arsenal defense to Target this week at least is very very strong indeed Wolves at home is a fantastic fixture after that of course they become a little bit sketchy and that's what is putting people off I think Oni CRA and Gabrielle uh from game we one onwards maybe over the likes of someone like aardal but for this game week I think they'll be great they've looked especially impressive from set pieces again in preseason as they did towards the end last season with rice taking those Corners now was a Gabrielle and Sela both scored the other day in one friendly both from set pieces so I think that's going to continue this year just because the center backs don't let that put you off they've got equal if not more chance than a lot of attacking fullbacks are getting attacking returns and of course in that Arsenal side they've got the potential for clean sheets more than a lot of sides so yeah Gabrielle a very nice pick and you'd question his minutes maybe with califur and other Arsenal assets availability coming back we've got urine Timber etc etc there is a bit more competition in that Arsenal defense so maybe s was the more nailed of the two and Gabrielle's had some issues with him surrounding K1 last year let's hope they don't repeat themselves for the algorithm sake at least trand Arnold doesn't need much discussion around him a very nice fixture against ipswitch he's looked impressive in preseason as well I think Liverpool as a whole have been quite good under slot so far and you know preseason C be misleading but if that's anything to go on then they should farewell in this first fixture against ipswitch and Trenton at 7 million compared to last season when he was 8 million definitely I think he's going to be in more teams come the game week one deadline but when there's people like quona at 4.5 there is an argument there as to whether the 2.5 million could be better spent elsewhere durn is another one the minutes might be an issue I think the signing of Kelly at Center back is interesting for Newcastle he could easily partner share in Center back and then Le H has played the majority of minutes at left back in preseason I think Eddie how is going to look to get the youngster some more game time and I predict him to start game week one but I would predict that burn starts in Center back alongside Fabian Sher and that seems to be the consensus of a lot of Newcastle fans and discussion and predicted lineups and whatnot on Twitter but of course you got to consider that with burn moving forward it is a very nice home fixture for Newcastle against Southampton and new promoted side see back them if they can return to their defensively solid ways of maybe the campaign prior to last uh then there could be a clean sheet in that one quite easily and durn is always a threat from set pieces to obviously into the Midfield we're going to see Muhammad Salah there as the captain away at ipswitch we've then got sacka again for that Arsenal's kind home fixture against wolves we've got Anthony Gordon and eay then rounding off the Midfield so a fair chunk of the bud budg going into these four assets here Gordon notoriously good at home the only issue with him for me would be the lack of minutes in preseason and that he has come back only recently I could easily see him being maybe subbed off early for someone like a harvey Barnes and for that reason maybe even looking towards someone like a Jacob Murphy as a one we option could be good or even maybe even just going with him in your team full stop and saving that 1.5 two million rather and just even banking it or investing it elsewhere in your team and going with an wild card or just reallocating funds a few game weeks down the line I like Murphy as a punt in that kind of Midfield area I'm not going to discuss Salah and sacka too much I think they're talking about in a lot of Realms but e is one that is more recent discussion topic due to the fact that Oscar Bob's got injured and Man City have been heavily linked or rumored with e he's got to buy out clause Man City could easily get in there and get the deal done in a matter of days or maybe even hours so if that does become news tomorrow at some point today if you're watching this early on Friday morning then make sure to keep an eye on that because it could come right down to the deadline when rumors start flying about and E's game time could become an issue if he's in transfer discussion talks and whatnot so worth keeping a close ey on that one as we approach the dead line and obviously uh could affect his game time in future game weeks to come as well but it's a nice fixture away at brenford obviously on penalties and all that the Talis man really of that Crystal Palace side who did look really good and so there's still all the argument for having him in your team and then up front we've got isach hav and Chris woods so three home fixtures three very good Strikers a few of them on penalties as well so you know very hard to argue against all three of these munice away at Manchester United could be another nice fixture I think that the Man City assets and the Fulham assets are ones with away games that might look tougher on paper but actually are really good options this week I couldn't squeeze many of them into my team either it was just hard to justify uh but yeah I think Man City and Fulham are teams that are going to be ones to start the season off well uh even with fixtures that don't look that nice compared to something like Southampton at home or Bournemouth at home like you see with Nottingham Forest in his Graphics so yeah equally still very much like Chris Wood I should be on penalties another one with game time issues if a I's back fit and available for for what I can see Chris wood is in my own personal side right now and if that's got anything to go on then that's my seal of approval for him Kai habits is another one that I do like I prefer him over someone like anal Watkins I think he does just have he's just grown into that Arsenal team I think he's the type of player who can go big in games as well and you know there's two or three attacking returns in one game leading to those Mega Halles is what can really make the difference in FPL and he's just that kind of player I really like the look of him and I think he could do well in game week one in particular and Alexander isak is the one just everyone owns really for the sake let's see who's down here on the bench I'm aware we spent quite a lot of time on the algorithm side today so we'll get into mine just in a moment we've got D who's an interesting one we've got Harry winks and we've got Barco so barco's one to keep an on Brian the new Defender there debate about whether he'll start on the right he's been designed to play there or whether he'll come in and have competition for Barco a left back I think with a 4.0 million Defender there's not really that much to lose anyway especially as you'll probably play the Wild Card in around game week six you know you maybe want to save it but for me I think barers may be still even worth the risk I think he's that good of an asset onset pieces Etc there's quite a high upside there and if you go for someone like a fe or Vesta card or whoever you go for instead the bar's pretty much on the floor and it's just going to be two points every game week uh so yeah D is an interesting one man united defense is pretty much a nogo for me with all the injuries Luke Shaw looks like he's out as well I just can't go there until I see some form of improvement you still got casemiro in CDM for Christ's sake so I can't really see the United defense improving too much so I'd stay away for now and let's have a look at my team then and have a quick discussion around the captaincy as well [Music] so hopefully this is showing up all right I have made some changes here I have still gone with Gordon I was very tempted to go with Murphy but I did have the extra funds so I just ended up going with him in the end up front couldn't get Harland in I've gone with Dominic salanki who I think will come straight in for Spurs and I can just see it in my foreshadowing the future him coming in and score an Embrace on his debut I just think he's that kind of player make a statement Spurs one of those teams that kind of start the season well and hit the ground running uh I think a game against Leicester is a good base for them to do that as well so he's coming to my team uh for this game week I've also gone with doo jot to complete my Liverpool triple up I think that he's just worth the punt given that he's very likely to start game week one um and in that Striker role he's just such a good finisher as well so that's why he's in there and I've double up on the Arsenal defense putting celra in alongside Gabrielle and Trent and then in goal I've just gone for Nick Pope instead so I've still got that Newcastle defensive asset uh to get a clean sheet in there so I didn't see the algorithm team before I made my side but there are quite a few similarities in the picks here you know two Strikers the same three midfielders the same and two defensive options the same I've got bco Howard Bellis and Lavia down they're just the basic funds on the bench but I have still gone with Muhammad Salah captaincy my predicted points total is lower if you want to check your own make sure to head over to Fantasy Football fix of course and use the assistant manager tool let's see why I've got my armb on Salah and why I'm not going for isach although it's very very [Music] tight so yeah it's very very difficult between these kind of four assets this week depending on who you own some people will have you know two of these players some people might have three of these players in pretty much everyone will have isach then it's going of be the two of these other three that you might have in your team this week but I think a lot of people will be on C Mohammad Salah if they own him if not then I think it becomes a bit of a tougher question between the likes of isak oand for example with the fixtures the fixtures do kind of go in favor of Salah and isach they're playing two promoted teams who don't have any expected goals conceded data from last season it's not really worth pulling data from Southampton the season prior just doesn't seem too relevant but the other two fixures it's no surprise to see that Wolves at home is a better fixture than Chelsea away although I would say it's worth noting that I don't think Chelsea away should be a red fixture attacking wise they've looked pretty hopeless in preseason I don't think they look very coordinated and I still do think that man city could easily score two plus goals in that game there uh even with the recent injury news and all that they've got the depth to cover it so yeah for what it's worth I think that Harland fixture against Chelsea is nowhere near as bad as it looks with those color comparisons there between the green and the red in terms of team performance last season Liverpool the strongest attack of the bunch here their rxg 2.4 uh you know kind of per 90 on average but the other teams not too far behind Man City were the closest on 2.2 but then it's Sal on individual note expected FPL points per 90 go in favor of him 8.35 and that's what gives him the overall highest predicted points total of any player for gameweek one and Harland actually the fourth highest of the bunch which I find maybe a little bit surprising but isak and saaka both have very strong at home fixtures and probably on penalties so yeah that's what that's what is the stats are saying that's what everything saying I'm saying that salah's probably just about the safest option to go for but there's some very other good the very strong other shouts here that you can pick and I'm not sure you can go too wrong with captaincy I know if you get it wrong so to speak and your rank doesn't look very healthy after game week one it can be a bit of a downer but you have to remember it's very it's season long we won't always get the chance to putt on Captain C they'll probably be one standout for many game weeks this season have your fun whilst you can in FPL and over it is just a game at the end of the day remember although we do take it sometimes a bit too much more seriously uh than it should be but yeah we'll that being said I wish you the best of luck for the start of the season I hope you have a very good game week one and you're happy with your rank come the end of it remember it's a marathon not a Sprint and the season is 38 game weeks not all in one but with that being said I wish you the best of luck and I hope to see you in the next video goodbye [Music],3169
14,fantasyfootballfixYT,PPcwL5vXcGs,"💰Best FPL Premium Alternatives - BUY Jota, AVOID Salah? | Fantasy Premier League Tips &amp; GW 1 Guide",2024-08-12T13:00:33Z,yes guys welcome back to another fancy football fix YouTube video my name is FPL nacho and in today's video we are going to be looking at some premium Alternatives in the game I really do believe that like of Mo Salah and B Saka do have players that are equally good FPL value that we need to consider for our gameweek 1 teams so as always if you look forward today's video please do make sure you drop a like and of course smash that subscribe button ahead of the new season without further Ado let's get into these alternatives to those premiums [Music] so first and foremost I need to state that premiums in the game are premiums for a reason they are the best options in the game and over the course of a 38 gameweek season I do truly believe that the premiums the most expensive of the ones they're going to be looking at will outscore their counterparts however FPL just isn't like that if we could own all of the premiums with a limited budget then we would do so but we only have 100 million so I do think sacrifices need to be made somewhere otherwise we would just have all of the premiums in the game so I do believe that when we need to look at these Alternatives we need to understand their price point are we saving money which all of these will offer some savings and also do they actually provide FPL value or is it worth just spending that little bit more and getting the premium to it so first and foremost we're going to be looking at Arsenal and bico Saka of course being the premium in that that Arsenal team at 10 million Martin odard is the one that I do think offers some great FPL value at 8.5 million now of course we have the likes of Kai havitz at 8 million but being a forward is a slightly more difficult way to compare him against bakaro Saka and Martinelli could prove to be amazing FPL value but at 7 million I actually need to see him deliver before I can actually have the confidence to invest in someone like Martinelli so take a look at the underly numbers for these two players you can see here that first and foremost B Saka does run away in each and every underlying stats so in terms of goals per 90 0.49 a really really good season for sacka odard on the other hand 0.23 goals per 90 and I think when we are looking at last season I do think odard for his own standards while he was one of the players of the season I don't think from an actual goal scoring perspective or chance creation perspective it was one of his best seasons to date I do think that we saw odard come a little bit deeper at times to help build up with Arsenal just because they were lacking that left sided midfielder at times to help take the weight away from him so I'm expecting going into this season a more advanced OD guard with Arsenal's recruitment in the Midfield hopefully with ra Sid midfielder coming in but in terms of XG again sacka leads the away at 0.48 compared to oar's 0.21 sacka was on penalties when we take a look at XG non pen it does come down to more 0.38 but still sacka leads the way there and as I mentioned I think we always associate odard being the Creator in this Arsenal team and while he is stacker also took that responsibility with 0.33 expected assists so Saka was basically doing everything for Arsenal last year he was the goal scorer he was the chance Creator and naturally HED a lot of the bonus points as well and as you can see his FPL points per 90 was more than that of odard so when we take a look at the underline numbers first and foremost it is a 1.5 5 million saving it's going to be the least saving of the other players that we're going to be looking at later on in this video and of course with sacka being on penalties the fixtures coming up Wolves at home Villa away Brighton at home Spurs away I think some people are looking at those opening fixures thinking maybe they can avoid Arsenal Alto together I think if you're in a position right now where you're looking to do an early wild card then an Arsenal attacker is almost a central in your FPL teams and a lot of people were talking about bakara Saka maybe not being available for game week one but we know what Etta is like he's always going to play sacka and it's worth noting he did come off the bench against Bayern leusen so I think there is no issues about bukara Saka starting in game week one for me I do think odard is a good alternative to bukara Saka but of all of the players that we're going to be looking at in this video I think this is the one where with 1.5 million saving I would actually rather just try and find the 1.5 million and get yourself B Saka in the team being on penalties you can see with the underlying numbers that he is considerably better than that of odard yes we might see an increase in od guard's numbers going into game week one but until we actually see it I would actually rather you find 1.5 million and just get sack it in at that 10 million price point however if you're building a draft with howand and Salah I think it's very difficult to also have bakar Saka there so if that is the case and you can only afford odard I do think his numbers will improve this season so I don't think a bad investment at all for your teams but I do prefer B Saku so let me know your thoughts in the comments let's move into the next alternative which is going to be of course at Chelsea so the two players that we're looking at here is going to be Inu and Co pman before we get into that I need to say that all of the numbers that you're seeing here is taken of course from fancy footballfix.com you can check out the link in the bio and importantly with less than a week until the gameweek one deadline we are having team reveals from some of the elite managers in the world so you can check that out over on fantasy footballfix.com these guys have all had consistent top 10K finishes and they are some of the best managers in the world so head over to the link in the bar to check out how their teams are looking ahead of gameweek one I certainly have been doing it myself so looking at the comparison here between in kunu and Cole Palmer first cat that we need to mention is of course Inu played very limited minutes last season only played around 3 or 400 minutes due to his injuries whereas Cole Palmer played majority of the Season Beyond gameweek five and was obviously the Talisman in that Chelsea team so remember when we're looking at these numbers we do have to take it with a little bit of pinch of salt with in kungu in particular however whereas with odard and sacka I spoke to you and said 1.5 million I think I'll just rather find the 1.5 maybe sacrifice a Defender and get yourself the better option at Chelsea there is a 4 million pound difference and this is when we really need to understand about price saving in FPL because of course I think Co Palmer over the course of the season is a better option than in kungu but when we're looking at4 million pound saving and what that can do to bolster the rest of your squad I think this is where we need to really take in consideration those player price points so in terms of the numbers goals per 90 what is really really impressive of Cole Palmer is that he played all of the season and still maintained a goal per 90 of 0.75 now of course he was on penalties that is a big factor but I think penalties is something that we can actually look at in terms of a negative manner any player that is on penalties naturally makes them a better option by default and Chelsea just so happened to be one of those teams that actually rack up a lot of penalties I think because the certain players they have those one One V one dribblers and lik of sterling in kungu obviously M on the right wing I do think penalties is going to be a consistent thing in Chelsea again this season and in terms of the XG per 90 again Cole Palmer at .58 but inu's numbers are fantastic but again under a very very small sample size 0.62 goals per 90 0.52 XG per 90 and also what we did see in kungu is when he was in that Chelsea team he was basically being the goal scorer in that team whereas Cole Palmer remained a chance Creator so when we look at the fixtures coming up man city at home isn't ideal but if there ever was a time to play Man City it probably is now while they still have some of their key players unavailable Wolves Away followed by Palace at home and then Bournemouth away I think the fixtures aren't as good as everybody's making out I think Wolves Away and bouth away are tricky fixtures but long term Chelsea definitely is a team that you would want to invest in from an attacking perspective I think we've seen enough of mesa's team in pron to to note that they're going to be very very flaky defensively but offensively they are creating chances and I do think they are consistently going to score goals under Mesa now when we look at the two this is a perfect example Cole Palmer is the better option if they were both prices the same price point but I think in kunu is the man to go for in gameweek one Co pal has played zero minutes during preseason at the time recording I do expect him to come in into this gameweek one team but in kungu has played pretty much all of the minutes in preseason it looks like moresa really trusts him in this team and I think inu's minutes are going to be as good as Co Palmer this season and for 4 million saving for a player who is an elite finisher I'd put him on the same bracket as Cole Palmer I think the Chelsea decision is quite a comfortable one here where you investing in kungu knowing that if Co Palmer does hit the ground running maybe an early wild card is the way to squeeze him back into your teams or maybe you go for B Saka as your premium alongside in kungu knowing that maybe if you really need to get Palmer you do sacker the co P once the fixtures get bad for Arsenal so for me it is quite clear in kungu is the man to invest at Chelsea let me know your thoughts in the comments so just a recap of course at Arsenal I think you do pay the extra get sacka at Chelsea I think you do pay the cheaper and go for in kungu I think Liverpool is the most difficult one to compare right now so Mo Sala of course being in the premium at 12.5 million we have a really interesting price saving here with the at 7.5 million I do think saos is interesting at 6.5 but I need to see a bit of clarification of where he's going to play in this Liverpool team but I think Diego is the natural replacement to mosalah if you are looking to avoid him now when we take a look at the underling numbers again J did play less minutes than mosalah but considerably more than likes of in kungu so I think we can come to some sort of conclusions on his numbers goals per 90 we know when J plays he scores goals he isn't necessarily the most gifted footballer but he knows where the net is 0.78 goals per 90 compared to Moos salah's .64 and a reminder obviously jot has no penalties in this mosalah does take into account penalties XG per 90 0.76 compared to J's 0.46 kind of highlighting J's finishing ability to be honest with you and in terms of assist per 90 jota putting up some really good numbers at 0.55 compared to mosala 0.43 in terms of big chances we always know mosal is going to dominate them in that uran klopp team and I think that's the big thing right now when we're looking at Liverpool similar to Chelsea we have so many uncertainties right now how the team are going to react off the back of yuren Club Leavin who is actually going to be the Talisman in this AR slot team because I know mosalah is still by default Liverpool's best attacker and it would make sense for Arnie slot to build the team around mosala but equally I think Arnie slot is coming into this team with his own philosophy and a way of playing and it doesn't necessarily mean that mosal is by default just going to be the go-to forward in this Liverpool attack I know he's the most expensive but he's the most expensive based on his time under Jurgen klopp and under Anie slot we may see maybe someone like Diego playing as a number nine be the go-to man in this Liverpool attack and again this is the biggest saving of all of them5 million pound saving is huge when we're looking to balance our squads out especially if you are going to go for earling Harland in your team and again it's worth noting if you are going to avoid mosala you almost certainly need need to have earling Howland as your main price premium asset so for me the fixtures are good for Liverpool IP switch away in game week one brenford at home followed by United and noton and Forest I think it's quite a scary Prospect to go without moal at longterm and I do think in terms of the short term maybe going for someone like a diot and saving that money might actually be a wise move we know the numbers are good but we don't really have any un certainty about how they're going to roll out their team week in week out I probably say jot is more of a rotation risk whereas mosala looks like he's always going to have that right hand side lock down jot is going to be comp competition with DAR Nunes with gakpo even someone like a sabosa if they look to maybe play a false nine in this system but for a short term if you're looking to maybe wild card in game week four with that brilliant home fix against noton and Forest I think maybe taking a punt on Diego shter is actually the route to go for understand whether mosala truly is the Talisman of that Liverpool team and if he is then of course while carding in game week four you can bring mosala back into your squads the other argument of course is that if you go for mosala and jot becomes the Talisman it's a much easier transition for you to just do with a free transfer Sal it down to jot and maybe postpone the Wild Card later down the line so for me with this I don't really know what we're going to get with any of these two assets I think if you're wild carded in game week four I would take the punt on jot at a cheaper price and invest the money elsewhere if you're looking at a longer turn wild card it's so difficult to go from jot to Salah I think by default you go for Moos Salah knowing that you can downgrade to Dogo xhot and of course this one is probably the closest of the two and I really do think that jot offers amazing value but it's just whether you're brave enough to swing against mosala so I think this one is a little bit dependent on when your wild card as I've discussed so to conclude I think you pay the little bit extra and you get bakarak in your team I think in kungu is clearly the better value pick than Kama and this one is all about your wild card Horizon for me I think jot is a great short-term pun so that is going to include the premium Alternatives in this video today guys I really hope it did provide some value and a little bit of food for thought with that deadline being on Friday as always

Fantasy Football Scout as we look ahead to game week two it's team news time my name is Joe and as ever I'm joined by fantasy football scouts editor Neil Neil welcome how are you on your phone again yes unfortunately still Haven rectifi that issue but I'll uh promise I'll do it at some point this season but I'm otherwise all right at your year not bad I think we've had updates from all 20 clubs now 12 today eight yesterday I'm ready to go yes I think I've got I think I've got all the little images and tweets on the screen now uh which is good um before we go on just a reminder everyone do press that like button does help us out and do remember subscribe wherever you're listening uh and watching uh this um also do check out the members area um Neil and the team there um full of lots of um articles um and uh data and number crunching activities there um lots of exclusive content and also we got an app this season as well um lots of tools and gadgets there to help you um win your mini leagues and and do well this season um let's start with uh Brighton against Manchester United my team against Manchester United what is the latest from Brighton and in particular with um Ace Winger Mina formerly of your club and his mythical concussion yeah minty is freshh for the weekend he didn't have well he did have a concussion they've have cleared it very very quickly um but I suggest it it wasn't a concussion as the social media was suggesting uh yes her said yesterday that he's afraid to play this week and he's available um so they follow the rules in the Premier League but he is fit so the flags come off him otherwise U we knew last week that lampy Ferguson and stupid back in training uh Ferguson and stupid have been out for a long time and again hope not sure whether they'll feure this weekend they're all in training um we're going to wait to see what happened today in the final training session um but suggest they're playing it pretty cautious with those three and they do have an efl Cup tie coming up next week which probably is a um more likely I think Prospect of them getting game time okay so so uh yeah I was going to say the move for Barco as well I know you did an article at Fantasy Football Scout about if he does go out Lan which is looking you know 99.9% certain he will um that he will get red flag then and that will end that will make it very difficult for his for any price changes there um but until then it's it's a free-for all isn't it yeah yeah until that flag's run until the loan's it's not just the laan being agreed it's an FPL action in the flag and sometimes that can take it's not necessarily instant can be a little wild but um yeah we we look through the last 50 50 examples of a loan move and in on none of the occasions did a price change after the flag went on so we assume that they are locked uh yeah her was pretty much confirming bar was we La he was nodding when the report asked him a question about whether he's off um didn't get any update on ver bran and C so on March but we assume they're still out ver bran is in the Dutch Squad M so yeah he's pretty close yeah I think I think the estimate was six weeks and I think we're in about the fifth week of that yeah um so it looks like um you know he could be back game week three um but it but yeah I would imagine after the international break definitely um Manchester United meanwhile um you know this this match can go either way um sometimes Manchester United do okay sometimes Brighton get the better of Manchester United um but yeah what's the latest for Manchester United yeah one new addition to the injury list he was already injured last week he just wasn't flagged and that's Victor Lindelof you've seen on crutches and it turns out he's got a tour injury I don't think it's too serious but he's joined the uh red flag Brigade which includes Shaw yoro hland and massia so five out I don't think there's anything new Sano apparently had an ear infection which I I very much Doubt last weekend but um I don't think Fitness is the deciding factor of his involvement anymore I think it's um ten Hog's preference to leave him out yeah ear infection that's like um code for just dropped okay let's move on to Crystal Palace against West Ham London Clash um yeah Crystal Palace I mean wow so much transfer news going on um in the other direction um lots of their players going elsewhere um yeah what is the latest yeah it does put you off some of their def I mean I've got deam Henderson in my team for example but I'm less sure about clean sheets now uh yok Merson and Jordan I are the two who are imminent in terms of Departures they're not going to be involved against West Ham obviously Anderson's off to Fulham I's off to Leicester Mar G he's still there for how newcastle's still ined but he will play tomorrow providing there's no update in the next 24 hours he's going to cap on the side I mean injury wise they're pretty much fine it's only franker who's uh who's peripheral anyway he's injured Will Hughes has gotten illness so he could drop out but they've got ample Replacements like the Kore and and L at they coming okay and meanwhile with West Ham as well another team has been very active and transfers in over the summer um so yeah what are what are their troops um like for this Clash quite a moisan update from lgu and that he he said stuff like let's see and wait and see hinted there was a little problem with one of the players but didn't really give us much to go off he did the only flag player they did have was Edson Alvarez and he did say he was progressing well uh whilst also pointing out he's been sidelined for a couple of months so um still some doubt over his involvement but uh a suggestion from lgre that there is a one new issue that he's not mentioning or name checking oh okay A little surprise for us like like we really need that this week uh Fulham against Leicester is next so Anderson um going going to Fulham so he s sort of in FPL limbo at the moment in between the clubs um so he won't be either um available for either game week two um nor will another new recruiter fullam mon stand yes sander Berger he's he's SED in the last couple of days but he's Silva said he's not quite ready to start uh they've got their Cup game after that which he'll feature in yeah I mean you know how imminent this deal is because Silva was willing to talk about Anderson and normally manages play everything on the straight but until something's over the over the line and pretty much seeing that the deal's close but as you see it not close enough for this weekend um f didn't have any flag players and we're not aware of of any injuries emerging from last week okay um meanwhile with Lester our favorite manager for the truth um Steve Cooper um what amazing truths has he been telling this week yeah for people who weren't watching us last week he said that vardy was a little while away still in rehab and then three days later he started and scored against against Spurs uh yeah he he reports that the injury situations unchanged from Monday night so expect lots of changes when they do take the field that means if we take him out his word they're still without Daka Cody and the backup goalkeeper with n can't pronounce St um i' probably butcher that one he did say that Oliver skipe is definitely available he's a new signing from Spurs joined this week and there was plenty quotes on V in terms of how to keep him fresh and um you know the strike I know on his own body back then any and then he sort of lives for game deers rather than training in between good news from people from the West Midlands who like prawn cocktail flavored crisps then with uh Oliver skip um okay let's move on to Man City against ipswitch us Harland owners this is it for us if he blanks in this I'm going to say it's season over so um yeah what's the latest for man city as ipswitch prepared to visit yeah a few updates and few a plenty of comments about the new arrival or the returning arrival of of uh IL gondan injuries first svino has made a quick return for and he he came off last week end with um I think pep called it a disturbance in his knee but he has trained partly since he did sound a little bit unsure about how what the extent of his involvement is going to be this weekend so uh the flag will remain on him rodri even less sure about his involvement it sounds like he's going to miss out again I think he said he had even SE in training yet they did have a session this afternoon but War session is not going to be enough Bob of course is red flag he's out for three to four months and then as I see the rest of the press conference was about IL gundan pretty much every question okay he could be he could even be involved tomorrow at Pep and um providing the International Paper was coming through and he's he's registered wellow could he I mean see the start seems unlikely but you never know um but I mean it sounds like he could be could be used as a substitute maybe yeah providing that the um red Taps you know clear and all that I think he might be on the bench um I don't there's anything wrong with the performances last week end cob Bernardo and de BR in the middle I don't think that's going to change necessarily this weekend so I I doubt be CH straight back in okay meanwhile with IP switch uh I know someone who won't be playing is Calvin Phillips who can't face his parent Club that's right yeah he um red flags on him just for one week um also not featuring is Wes Burns so he came off against Liverpool with a hounding injury it's going to be weeks according McKenna not going to be imminent um which is potentially good news for for Ben JNS I see a potentially because he effectively started over him last weekend um even though Burns is more of a wing and Johnson's more right back but in this sort of hybrid system you know with the the right one the right back or right winger pushed up and with Twan behind him then he could potentially come in especially this weekend I think against Man City okay but longer term there is you know there is there is even with burns out there's other Alternatives you can player um injuries yeah Burns aside from him HST still out Broadhead still out I think Harry Clark as well cinged Mich is partly trained we didn't know about this he missed out last weekend H with a a calf injury but um he has returned at training a late call is going to be made on his involvement and I think that's it okay um sampton against Nottingham Forest um sort of the bad the uh the battle of the the enablers if we've got any in our in our Squad um because they're quite well priced in FPL uh let's go with the home side first what's the latest there didn't really get much team news from Russell Martin um we the only injury serious on that we about is bazun who's out until 2025 kill's injury um others like San Lana Stewart Larios they're all in training they're all making their way back from injury I think the car car Cup tie next week is going to be the the realistic Target for those um and some quotes on on two new sigs this week oguk will and Fernandez um Martin again hitting that they're going to be on the bench fing sessions as all they've had and he was quite impressed with the performance at Newcastle last week so I don't much is going to change from that to G okay and Nan Forest they had quite a few injury problems from their last their gameweek one match uh what's the latest there yeah one serious one is danelo so he is going to have surgery next week on that I think it was a fractured angle and there's no time skill yet but it's going to be months and months and months for him we didn't get an update at least not I've seen in the broadcast section on AA and alanga who came off I think after 54 minutes last weekend the notam posts at the time described them as slight I think this described Al langas as an eye injury um so we not had anything on those two so that's why the flags remain on um it turns out that milenovic was suspended last weekend no not Forest didn't mention anything and it wasn't reported by the Premier League because he'd been sent off for Fiorentina last season in April and the ban carried over ah so I think he's available this week um I think was just think just war match um Moreno is not Forest player he's joined on alone from Villa but he's yet to train of his teammate so again probably not going to be featuring this weekend okay next one is probably the the headline one um lots of news at Tottenham um so let's just start with Tottenham against Everton what is the latest from Tottenham um mixed mixed use for those invested in Spurs I think good for por owners and bad for Salan owners por is fine so we been past he's trained all week uh so that's good salanki um there were rumors emanating from yesterday I think because he wasn't seen in the training ground footage and it turns out there's actually some some uh truth behind that and that he uh he picked up a knock gave it one on his angle not the serious but POA said it flared up and he's definitely going to be out of the everon game beyond that um I'll I'll give you the quote he said he said he's definitely out tomorrow and then it just depends on the recovery obviously next week then there's the international break but it's not serious we know that so the fact that he mentioned the international break there yeah do make me wonder whether he's out will game week four defin the least yeah also also out by the way sorry not as not as impactful on fantasy managers but Benton Coes out with a concussion protocol okay assume was back from the naughty step H and Rison is fit but he hasn't played for ages so um I wonder if it's kulesi up top again is is slank in your team nope no he wasn't he was in drafts but I took him out near to the start of season and I'm thankful for that yeah I'm I'm one of the 1.38% of managers that has salanki Barco and quansa so I've got I've got a really I've got a really good bench but um yeah so with sank I'm I'm actually going to just hold him uh because I'm going to use two free transfers next week and that might be something that those listening and watching might want to do they might want him to move out now but I think I'm I might have a few more options next week and I've got my eye on certain players that having two free transfers would be very handy to get um meanwhile Everton as well um annoyingly for those with salanki this would have been the money game and um because Everton have got some injury problems haven't they yeah definitely I mean we we were putting sun in the Scout pigs this week um would have been soank we had change it very late uh yes normally saw defensively robust Everton but they are really struggling for numbers at the back so Branford is not going to be back neither's Coleman or Patterson and then further for Garner and Chim a red flagged as well they're going to miss Ashley Young say Miss they're going to be without Ashley Young um through suspension uh whilst on top of all that JM toosi is now a fresh doubt and maybe B call him with a I think it's a hamstring niggle it's been reported elsewhere so um they're going to have a look at that so they could be I mean they could be without three quarters of last season's First Choice defense only moleno really surviving just rubbing it in rubbing it in so I I I suspect do you think that kazki is going to come in um for sanki or do you think Rich charison might get the nod my first instinct and I'll I'll obviously check this as the day goes on I think kesi would would probably start with Johnson and um sun in the front three Rich Charon hasn't didn't feature at all in preseason he has been training for a couple of weeks but even POA kugu said you know mentioned this afternoon he's ready to play but he has been without game time for a long time so my predict the lineup unless I say anything different is going to be um kesi through the middle okay right to you um so yeah anyone who wants to make that sort of one like for like swap with richison that might be a bit tricky um Aston Villa against Arsenal um there's going to be some interest in olle Watkins I would imagine for amongst Salan owners um coming up soon but um yeah what's uh not for this Clash though against Arsenal that's a tough one what state are Aston Villa in though for this yeah emy's press conference was the last one we've seen this afternoon it's always it's always late on a on a Friday lunchtime he said no fresh injuries so we were expecting Matty cash to be to be um flagged because he he seemed to come off last week game holding his hamstring emry see no fresh injuries I did see elsewhere that cash hasn't actually been seen in training so either emy's keeping his CL his cards very close to his chest or he's just forgetting to mention cash um nothing much else uh Mings and kamaro's updates on those two they've been out for a long long time um Mings uh is starting to work with the team um working mostly alone in terms of training and Kamar is in a few weeks he'll start training so there's still other side interntional break in terms of um competitive comebacks okay meanwhile with Arsenal I think um there was there there were quite a few uh injuries over the summer um which are sort of clearing up a bit but yeah what what's the latest with Arsenal yeah nothing much today from Mar in terms of injuries I don't think was even asked um actually was but then he he's decided to talk about something else Timber which I'll come in a second I think they're still without Tommy Asam TIY so they were the ones from Summer who are lingering and um our said last week last week it'll be a few weeks time viir as the other one again not someone trouble to stting 11 but he's had a slight hit problem missed out against seia in the final friendly missed out against wols last week so he remains it out okay otherwise um those just quotes on Dean Rice's uh preferred position there was couple of qutes on Timber um who came off the bench last week G for in chenko oura said he's had a really good preseason um but we have to build him up we have to be cautious so I'm not sure if he's ready to start okay righto um Bournemouth against Newcastle um it's the it's the Eddie how derby um how how are Bournemouth post salanki I can't believe he didn't miss a single minute for them through injury last season and he's at Spurs for one game and he's out in injured I mean that's that's so Spurs but anyway spur isn't it so spursy uh boury how are Bournemouth yeah we didn't get an update I don't think we've had an update on the injuries I again I'll um I'll look into this once I'm off air but it was only the three that we were aware of unal Brooks somebody else who are forgetting already but um most of the quotes that I've seen so far concerned the new boy Evan Nielson the new the salanki replacement he's trained this week he's registered now he of course he wasn't last weekend so um I said he I think for sure he's going to be involved in this game okay whether that's from the start whether that's from the bench U but he's he's had a full week of training Jefferson's still there as well the four million 4.5 million forward um buta hinting heavily that it could still happen that he'll go out on loan nothing's happened this week so he'll be in the squad but okay next week before the deadline he might be off so okay he is not someone going to be able to call on for a minute think um Fabian Sher for Newcastle he's definitely out because he's suspended we all saw that um so he out for three matches um but what what else is the latest from Newcastle yeah they Peel Field predictably um one of the matches will be served in the in the carabal cup next week so it's just two premier league okay matches he's absent for which is slightly helpful for us um otherwise I think it's much of a muchness the sales bought in Miley longer term Wilson's shorter term but he's still I don't think he's back yet uh tanali this is his last ban last game he's going to be banned for after 10 months wow so he be back yeah we should see him in the in the cup next week against forest and then in the squad in the league from then on um trip year and Target both got 45 minutes for the 21s on Monday Target's been out a long time trip just getting a match fit after the euros and there was quite a few quotes on on tripier from how seeing that um he actually surprised by the the reports this week suggesting he wanted to move away because that's not not the case uh he's trained all week he's still a valuable member of the squad etc etc uh which doesn't necessarily mean he's going to come back in the team because I think liver M and all have got the shirts for now um yeah I think that's pretty much it from a team yeah I would imagine I mean you as a Newcastle fan I mean I mean basically all the speculation in the press as you said with liento playing well um chip chippy is going isn't he I He's 33 um this you know I think last season was his last one really at Newcastle do you think well not from what you got from how this morning I mean he he said he was surprised the report so um I would still wouldn't rule out the prospect of him leaving by the end of August I very much doubt that he's throwing throwing TI out the pram off the back of one game though the implication was that he wanted more game time he just just been one game and he wasn't fit and and game one so he was never going to start that match anyway because because of his late return so I I doubt very much whether the reportage on this is completely accurate okay but I still I still think he is dispensable in terms of okay wages and and financial fair play and all I think I think they might move them on despite what H say okay uh wolves against Chelsea let's go with Wolves first before we go with Chelsea because Chelsea were in action last night so we've got um a little bit of information from last night from Chelsea let's go with Wolves first yeah nothing new from O'Neal uh he said that um kuna's fine he came off the bench last weekend and he's available for more minutes trayor as well have an extra week of training everyone was fine as we were so that just means uh three long-term absentees chomi kagic and Gonzalez and SEO this is his last game that he's banned for as well right all as you were okay uh with Chelsea I think there there was some um reports I saw that Palmer was limping after Chelsea's game last night is he is he okay do we know yeah we didn't we haven't gotting up yet on this from from Resa because he the game week two section of this press conference was was last night immed after the game and it was just unar quar so I've not seen anything on that I will delve into this but someone did a reporter did ask pal as he's going through the mixone are you okay and he said yeah so we think he's all right but players have been positive about their prognosis before and then been wrong um yeah uh quotes from maresa from last night there nothing in terms of injuries but some interesting ones nonetheless uh about Felix and Netto to start with um Felix is available um he sort of flip-flopped on whether he's gonna get significant minutes he said that he's physically ready because he's played games at Atletico and but he just needs more time to understand the club and the way they're going to play Etc so I think he's again pointing towards bench Duty and possibly the same for Pedro n as well who was on the bench last weekend uh played last night against svette but said that um the last time Pedro played 90 minutes was in February and that was a long time ago and we need him to build a little more more physical condition and to give him another game on Sunday is probably too early so suggesting that he's he's going to be benched again a bit of a boost to Sanchez owners as well if you do own him uh he said that the plan probably at the moment is to play um Jorgenson in the cups and Sanchez in the Premier League it is dependent on performance of course so if he does make a series of Ricks then he could come out but for now Sanchez is the is the Premier League goalkeeper if I can just go back to Bournemouth because I forgot about sessi I did forgot to mention him he was last anybody's now fine okay righto um and final match uh Liverpool against brenford um obviously um not good news for Quan owners dropped now injured I hear yeah not not a significant one we don't think um but quite a convenient one for take him out the start 11 in terms of in terms of slot uh he had an injury on Tuesday in training then he couldn't train the following day um slot say they're going to try and see if he can if he can train today this afternoon so maybe there'll be some images emerging from the Liverpool Camp after we're off air but it does very much sound like he's going to he's going to miss out this this weekend he's already dropping price as well uh otherwise he said he reacted well to the to the uh I guess it was kind of criticism from from sloth even though he says you got one job and you're rubbish at it basically yeah he's kind he's kind of try a back track afterwards saying that everyone lost D you know it was it was a team thing but um he did mention again that he lost a couple four half times everyone was rubbish I just happen to take yeah when your job is to win jewels prospects aren't great for Point going forward um and that was pretty much it I think we're not aware of any other injuries at Liverpool meanwhile at brenford the Ivan Tony Saga still rumbles on he could actually play couldn't he he could he's still technically a brenford player uh but he was last weekend as well and he wasn't he wasn't involved in the squad then uh there's suggestions that he's in discussions with um katari side I think alali possibly was it Saudi Arabia anyway somewhere in the Middle East um so yeah this afternoon Frank gave the most non-committed answer let me get the quote he said who knows let's see what will happen he could be involved he could not be involved he could be here after the 30th he could not be here after the 30th basically everything's up in the air he said I to so um maybe it's going to be last week's front R again okay uh Thiago Sila hickey still injured Henry's almost back he's been out a long long time but he's training fully with a group and um a return is is imminent uh they've also signed a four million FPL Defender this week SE venberg from Liverpool for a lot of money I think was a 25 million or something okay so they obviously say future in him uh in terms of starting it wouldn't shell out that much money I think with um bench Duty in M but for now there there's a lot of competition there's um Ben May was just back from injury Ethan pinnick and Ethan Collins started last week Aya who is probably a center half but he's been filling in a fullback so they've got four Center halfs that could compete with Vandenberg in the short term but definitely went for the watch list in the longer term um bar Warners and Quan Warners because he he could in the medium to um establish himself in that brenford team yeah I will be a little more cautious this time when I go for four million uh Defenders um if any um okay let's round up uh what we got so far I just sort of put the key ones what you know might be in likely to be in people's teams or or will influence games uh available Mina with concussion he wasn't really concussed but um he's all fine he was flagged though um all fine questionable though Mich with his car problems talkowski could be out with an injury a langa we don't know what's happening with his eye injury same with Ana and his knock uh quansa conveniently has a knock um and saevinho also has a knock for Manchester City came off in gameweek one um but he could he could play this time out um major doubts um if I put doubts B and out daa and Cody because you never know because it's Steve Cooper giving the press conferences there rodri very very very unlikely to play because of Fitness issues um meanwhile out uh Calvin Phillips is ineligible to play against Man City his parent Club bran White's groin issues still Linger on so does Patterson his ankle problems Danilo his ankle is going to keep out longterm Fabian Sher is going to be out for three matches but two of which are in the Premier League so this is the first of two Premier League matches he will be suspended for uh Lindelof toe problems um salanki is sanle problems uh there Anderson uh I've just put transfer here because he's sort of in limbo I could put just the word limbo in as well he's in between clubs uh same with Jordan aou as well and and same with Berg really although he is um he is now with a club but um you know he's only just moved so it's unlikely he he's he is definitely not going to play um so I think I think we got most things there yeah I think so Jo yeah I think that's pretty much summed it up right yeah excellent thanks so much for joining me um thanks so much everyone who's joined us in the live chat I didn't say hello to you all uh earlier I was such a such a race to get to all the all the flags in my team um sucan um Delia FPL scop j77 lag Mr feather uh kickabout FPL um Noah Morgan Jones uh Eric G and ab uh thanks so much for joining us you're just some of the many uh hundreds that have joined us in the live chat thanks a lot for that um hope we've given you the team news that we require probably not that you want though especially if you're salanki or k Quanza owner like me um I won't be here next week um uh but I will be the following not the following week the following time after that because there's an international break in game week four so there's two we break there so I'll be back in a couple of weeks or so uh ahead of game week four um but you'll be back next week Neil uh with someone else uh to give all the team use for game week three um thanks a lot for your time take care see you soon thanks sure bye-bye,5896
17,FFScout_,xX-8dQOjvS0,FPL DEADLINE DILEMMAS GW2! 💥 | FINAL THOUGHTS! | Fantasy Premier League Tips 2024/25,2024-08-23T09:45:05Z,"[Applause] hello everybody Welcome to deadline dilemas this is episode number two uh for those you who missed it we did an episode one but it was right in the middle of a Friday deadline before game week one so some of you might have missed it we have the new co-host for deadline dilemas that is trophy FPL or mo mo welcome again to the second than very much uh it's a pleasure to be here yeah if you missed last week it's it was a good episode so definitely catch up but this week we've got lot to talk about honestly we have lots to talk about and uh it's a Thursday night and I think by the time people will listen to this it'll be a Friday morning so as usual we will keep it short and sweet this idea of this podcast is to complement the other pods that we do on on FF Scout so this is not a long form content it's basically to supplement those other burning questions and Scout casts so we'll primarily be focused on our teams our last minute decisions but before we do that let's talk about our game week one teams not because I want to basically tell Mo that he had had a terrible week but I want people to feel okay that it's week one so tell me about it what what did you go with then how did game week one go so it was a very difficult week a lot of things went not great for me pres I start so Henderson not a big issue no every goalkeepers isn't it Trent went really well the first big stumbling block was K Quanza now this has been a talking point this week he's gone down in price and a little bit of a spoiler he's someone I had to consider moving out but so he was the first issue slot was right to be fair to him it's ruthless it sounds bad because on the ey he seemed like he was having a good game but the reality is once ebo came on he made a big difference and allowed us to control the game so he was my first issue one point yeah it a double issue actually because then he was a trans for potential price drop so that's the first one Hall was no problem Five Points which was incredible press considering they had a man down so early yeah no I I was happy with whole five-pointer uh you know we can be greedy and he got a yellow card the full six but also they considered like 2 XG so I was happy with the whole points as well he had a bit of a shaky game that's one of the I watched obviously I'm so excited to have the football backs I watched quite a lot a lot of live football matches and he had a bit of a Ry game I will say that but they hung in there and fair play to new Carle jolton in that game was like my goodness he was like three players so so that that was my defense all in all not the worst it was one blank there which is he got taken off at Hal time Midfield will start with a positive jotter could got two or three goals but we'll take the one the one goal EXC excellent excellent goal by Liverpool and then is when the problems start press so first of all inuko you don't have him you've managed to dodge this pain in the butt and even today we've just seen he's scored a penalty and he's come off early again he's won the penalty let's let's talk positives as well Mo he won the penalty uh which is which is going to be true even if he's not on pens in the Premier League so that was good he played in the number 10 that was good yep they all POS he's getting he's getting closer to more Fitness so I agree with you there is some positives there but again he is definitely being managed and with the amount of luxuries maresa has up front it is something we might see the next couple of weeks if he played 80 minutes what would you say no 8 minutes is fine I think PR said oh he's played too much now you know he must start in the weekend so if he plays less then people will say oh he's being managed if he plays a lot people will say oh he he he will he'll miss the next game because he'll be tired scenarios yeah no you're right it's how we paint the narrative you're right he comes off early he's being rested and prepared for wolves as it's an important game because they want to get Victory after the defeat against City or this is what we're going to see for the next couple of weeks while they look after him because he practically missed the whole year of football so I'm not sure which one we want to take there and I've got a really big dilemma actually which is perfect for us in this video because um and it involves him and we'll talk about more more about that later on yeah next midfielder was Bruno Fernandez now this one here how do you explain this I would have been on par I reckon with the other scores in game week one if he actually converted one of these chances think one huge chances huge chances PR yeah yeah I mean you watch the game yourself I I watched the game I was at fif watching the game and Lords of us had Brun all day and we couldn't believe what we witnessed like he should have like banged one just one of them would have meant a decent game week but for him to miss those two chances was absolutely criminal so yeah that was one of the big stumbling blocks and then the last midfielder was Gordon got three points and the reason I say that was it is a blank but it's because that red card destroyed the triple Newcastle you did yeah you had the same triple up yeah I expected I mean there was a bit of Hope because when the red card happened they moved they changed into a 432 and Gordon went up top of ISAC and then that times he covers the wide play and I don't you know it's a bit like rashford where sometimes we get excited oh my player is playing up top but players like rashford Gordon what they need is basically isolated on the wing and then when they get the ball they run at their you know their their corresponding Defender they dribble past them go into the box take a shot or cross the ball that's their strength and I think that's same for Gordon same for rashford so similar to rashford when he starts up top I don't like it I was not happy Gordon needs to stay on the wing and attack the the defender which he couldn't couldn't do no I totally agree with you in normal circumstances I'm I'm happy with that the reason I mentioned that because I thought there was a bit of Hope cuz normally if you get a man down and you turn into a 441 you you have to work so hard because you're you're outnumbered that very rare you get to attack positions where as he went into the sort of front position I thought you never know with the counter he could still pluck something this was me really hopeful but the reality was once sha got that red card I I I I thought this game is is over FPL wise but so that was the Midfield the Midfield was under like realistically it was one return from jar so that was very painful yeah so you could see where the team's going why had a difficult week and then the other one because the other two are obvious harand and and ISAC the other one was salanki similar to Bruno pra you watched that game did you see the chances he had in the first 20 minutes he did but I think Bruno had the bigger chances like I I feel like he was a little bit I don't want to say Rusty but you know Spurs themselves were trying to find a way they were very attacking like I was I was way worried like I didn't have son I didn't have sanii I didn't have porro and then once por scored I'm like okay I am I'm going down in this game but but you know yeah sank was close and I think he's still a good pick I think he's a good pick I'm excited obviously we talk more about game week two but um so that just summed up realistically how game week one went for me it was a net it was 50 points very low I mean it was below the average what was the average 62 or something I can't remember I couldn't even bring myself to log in so when it's a week like that I just leave it and think about game two I hear you look I think the main difference in our team is I had a second premium or actually in other teams that did well this week they had a s or a Salah addition to H that's the difference yeah so if you had a Saka or a Salah you get basically 10 12 more points so I got 63 if you had both and you didn't have Holland then you got a 70 70ish if you Captain Salah then you got an 80 so that's basically the summary of the week so it is actually yeah um and so look I wouldn't I wouldn't beat myself too much about it because this thing will SW will will swing some week Salah will blank Saka will hul some week both will blank and your other guys you know the the mid-priced premiums or not premiums but mid priced midfielders like the Inus the jotas the Gordons will do well some weeks Holland will score well some weeks he won't so I wouldn't worry about a week I think and this this is I'm not not just talking to you I think I'm talking to pretty much everyone in general yeah because there's quite a lot that have this sort of setup here exactly so this week no Holland teams did well because a lot of the good Defenders kept clean sheets a lot of the midfielders Saka and Salah did well next week it could be Holland that scores a hattrick and you know Salah blanks and then suddenly the no Holland teams are completely on the floor and and and so on so forth so I think there's no one structure that U that works so I wanted to have that calm conversation because part of deadline dilemmas is to calm people down not to panic people to take hits on a Thursday night or or to panic about their team so that's where we are how was your game we though Smo in M wasn't it 63 is not too bad 63 is okay yeah I mean I think uh I'm happy with my Liverpool triple up I've got Tren Salah and J I think a lot of people will be looking to get to a triple up by game week 456 U so it's good that I already have that in place um was a good move yeah um yeah and and you know my forward line is okay like Xiao Pedro maybe I would have preferred a mun like if I look at the fixtures going forward but Cho Pedro is fine he's very cheap I've got Rogers who I'm happy with I think he played well for Villa um so although Rahe Sterling Rahim Sterling could go there and interrupt it he could he could interrupt it so that that's the thing about the transfer window you need to be open but where I am is I had no pressing injury concerns and so I'm happy to take this team forward let's just go to our teams then maybe that's the way to to do it I think so let's let's let's get stuck into let's go straight into my team first pres yeah go for it so here's first thing I've done this week was K Quanza I was really upset I was hoping the masses didn't make the move for him because I still had this small chance that he could play people think he's banished forever he's not he's a very good player he had a difficult game I switch Striker was wasn't him Havoc he was and you could see the stat showed it was 50/50 in the jewels and that's not good enough for obviously against a promoted team so I was upset I would have I would have benched him anyway but I wanted to bank the transfer that's what I wanted PR like to be in that position but so it is what it is so what I've gone and done first thing I've done is I've moved him to a 4 million now because I think I've got enough confidence now with rotation I don't mind putting um H with normally third bench and then cona Robinson and they can rotate if that makes for for the position I'm comfortable with that I mean this is now my defense except I have Barco instead of Howard Bellis so I I like the rotation in this defense yeah so the re and the reason I freed that money up which I'm moving across so I've started obviously Henderson there's no choice I don't have a backup goalkeeper Trent more than happy with uh Robinson we watched the live he was pretty good and it looks like even Manchester United are keeping an eye on him if he was to believe the rumors on yeah yeah he a very good player Hall even though he was a sketchy performance so hopefully keeps his position so that's not a problem as well so that's the back three in Midfield J Ian you only need Hall to play this week after this kza is playable for the next few I was about to say yeah it's not the most exciting pick though if I'm honest with you but it's something kza yeah yeah it's fine man I mean exciting picks don't play you know Quanza is exciting he's exciting he plays every minute yeah yeah I'm not gonna Jinx that but yeah you are right that's why I put him in I needed a bit of stability especially when I had some question not questionable but a bit more risk SK picks like quansa so defense picks itself in Midfield J her after last week I actually considered per I know it sounds going to sound ludicrous but I did think to myself he could even be Captain because if he's going to play 180 0 minutes against brenford I do see Liverpool scoring three goals three four goal they could match City the way they're playing on the slot I'm pretty confident honestly the way way you saw that second half it was like 25 minutes and we should have scored seven goals so if we can start like that brenford could be in trouble here but to counter you I mean I have Salah J so I would love for you to be right but as a balanced opinion I also think brenford are no mugs I mean the way they controlled I mean they gave up some chances they did give up some chances yeah but but they are a mature Premier League team that know not to give big chances Thomas Frank has played Liverpool many times obviously it's slot it's a different manager but he has played the team many times like you I I feel very hesitant to call a thrashing against brenford like like even City struggled against brenford so I'm not saying Liverpool will draw or anything no I hear you to call anything over two goals is difficult I think it's the anfield proposition that that's making me think that something could happen here but you are right if if there's no goal in the first half I change my opinion straight away I just think the way on the slot the sustain attacks I do think if a goal goes in in the first half I think we could be on to what I said maybe three goals but you are right that's maybe over exaggerating it but J obviously he a pi he's an excellent pick and I'm almost jealous now I don't have Sola with this fixtion the way Salah is looking so you're in a good position the next position is the one that I've got my dilemma which is perfect for this video so I've got Inu versus Smith roll and I'm genuinely not sure which one to play I've done a video on my channel press detailing all the stats between U so taking looking at what happened in game week one and then looking at the predicted points and predicted goals and predicted clean sheets for the oppositions they playing and try to like work something out and it was so tight honestly so difficult so I'd love to hear your opinion what do you think they because they both played similar minutes in game week one I mean Smith R just about got to 63 minutes obviously in cuckoo Smith roll I think it's got the better fixture you re leester at home isn't it I would go for Smith row that's my gut feeli I mean I have him I just think if you're not going to play him Lester at home then why do you have him like I was about to say um like even if he gets 65 70 minutes it's a better fix on paper against a Wolves at home Wolves Away for Inu um Inu is great like nothing against him but I think his expected minutes for Smith are higher than Inu like in kungu I would expect 55 to 65 minutes against wolves Smith row 65 to 70 minutes and then if you look at the fixture I think it's a better fixture for Smith row nobody none of them are on penalties none of them are on set pieces yeah I just think it's the fixture to Target I think that's the conclusion I came to the fixture and the potential predicting minutes obviously is very difficult we know that we we are really reaching here because they both had similar minutes in in game week one you could argue that both or obviously Smith R just joined a new club so I'm not sure if he's going to jump straight into 90 minutes but I do think he will get more minutes and that's the one so you're thinking yeah at the moment I've still gotten cucko in that position but is between them and that's a big dilemma because I don't want to drop Bruno yeah they had a good performance against U Fulham I know it was at home Brighton will be a different proposition of course but he's one of those players par from the pen you can't drop Bruno no when you have a player on free kicks and and penalties um that's a different proposition if Inu was on penalties like today's game tonight's game he he won the pen and scored the pen of course he won't score pens but if he was on them then you don't drop him like I Inu yeah you would have had him you and yeah of course I totally agree with you so at the moment that's the dilemma and I've been going back and forth B me thinks Chelsea is a superior team I mean I know at the moment Chelsea are all over the place but reality is they are a superior team well let's go to Rob's slide let's have a look so so if you look at this Roby graphic I think uh what you see is Fulham is expected to score 1.75 goals and Chelsea is expected to score 1.95 goals so basically you have to take the team strength out of it they're both expected to score similar amount of goals and then basically uh you have to look at uh how much of a Talisman they are right I mean Smith R will share his goals with Muniz maybe Andres Pereira um that's it right yeah but and kungu is going to share his goals with Palmer with Jackson with Netto with Enzo Fernandez now I'm not saying all of them will score but I'm just saying it's it's he's not as talismanic I mean he's a way better player than ESR is but I just I just I just feel it's worth going for that upside ler fixture so I know you're saying this obviously if you don't own inuko would you have the same thinking PR you you you would I would definitely play Smith over I mean this is the reason I went for a Smith row is because I felt that if I can not play him in game week one where he played away to man united I ended up playing Rogers now Rogers blanked himself so it didn't matter but uh the idea was that hopefully I can somewhat cover Inu I know Inu is better but you also play p a million more for him so that was the thinking for this week at least and then you reevaluate next week I think there's enough reason now the only spanner in what I've said now is basically tonight Palmer there are some videos showing that Palmer has gone off at the end of the game holding his thigh now it could be nothing but if that is the case um then unu could be on pens so that changes everything that would change everything yeah because then his pen share goes up yeah as in pen share he's probably on pens if they win a penalty against wolves definitely Y in that case I would start Smith so it all comes down to the press conference on what anyone says about Palmer I guess yeah if Palmer is a doubt I would leave inuko in 100% because it changes it straight away because even in preseason he scored two penalties when Palmer wasn't there correct tonight as well so straight away that just gives him that extra then your dilemma becomes Gordon versus ESR in my view because look at Newcastle Newcastle are 1.8 goals expected and Fula 1.75 again nothing in it it's close that one there I that one for some reason didn't really come into my head because I just think Gordon I've got something I don't know maybe it's too much bias I've got towards him but I really fancy him and I did fancy him in the first game I was really upset with a red card but uh that is for me it was O between and cuckoo because I think Gordon's going to get the minutes that's the reason per I think he'll get enough opportunity where the game start becoming end to end in the last 20 minutes I think gon will be there fair enough if that's your view that's okay that's what I'm think yeah that's what I'm I think that's what edges it for me but the inuko penalty thing could be a game changer I would keep him in the team but it would be a shame like you said I bought ESR in for these moments and then all of a sudden he just sits on the bench good bench it's okay to have a bench cover to be honest it's not the end of the world well we've seen with game week just in game week one with Barco potentially porl with K Quan up a bench is is needed yeah you know Ben without a doubt so let me flick back to my uh to my team if I can flick back every time I click this here here we go there we go this is your team let's go back yeah yeah we're good to go so I think I think that's that's fine if you want to keep it like this I don't think it's a bad move I mean I would play Konza over Howard Bellis though uh or maybe not actually it's fine I don't against Arsenal I think even though AST Villa are so good I just think they've done a double on them press and that's the reason I'm thinking I think that adds to why I think they're not going to win this time orich I'm thinking is I'm thinking Arsenal now have to go there and show if there's an improvement this is the game they need to show the Improvement yeah fair enough fair enough so that's the reason I was thinking that but you are right obviously it's a superior play but I'm hoping I don't reach that far in my bench I mean I'm hoping the defense actually like the whole team starts and plays yeah so what do you think PR what do you think first of all my transfer situation was it was not a nice predicament to be in wol Kwanza being almost forced because I didn't want to lose that 0.1 and the reason for that is and I'll give you a bit of insight what the thinking was I'm really hot on E and I would if I see any more in cuckoo if he keeps on giving me headaches say another 57 minute transfer it is a possibility I could go in cucko to a and I needed that 0.5 because that's the exact money I couldn't afford to lose that right right oh so you have 0.5 in the bank yeah okay okay so that's the reason because I went from Quanza 4.5 to Howard who's four so I started to think ahead I was thinking you know what the rotation like you said Robinson and cona are be good enough for upcoming game weeks let me bring that 0.5 in and start thinking of E I saw enough in game week one I know why you're so hot on him seven shots it didn't go unnoticed for me prz even though he didn't anything I mean he was unfortunate with that disallowed goal but I've seen enough to think now you know what I I want him in my Midfield and if there's any more in this upcoming game weeks you know saying cucko carries on doing what he's you know done in game week one I could move that got it got it yeah I'm with you I think uh it makes sense in your position though now I've understood you had Robinson Hall and kza already I would have let I would have let him drop but it's fine you did it so I don't want to stop you it was no but it was that vers the the power of the the rolling of the transfer versus losing the the point one and just say if I do need to make that move that's what went through my head say game week two I really want I want that option to be there yes the transfer is I would love to have to roll a transfer I'm behind not just in points I'm behind in transfers being banked I know but that's the way the game goes at times it's unfortunate you know so that was my thinking there with that I make the move I nearly never done it because part of me thinks he could actually play how about that you know how annoyed we' all be but uh look I think I think that's a solid five now now that You' made the move and you have 0. five banked so I I agree with you that's something that you can explore the only downside is next week they could be double moves that become popular you know so then you know like if isack gets injured actually you could do isack to Watkins with your 0.5 so you do have a lot of rootes release money I get it that's the reason I done it PR exactly what you said to open up or or I could go from just say San again he might be it's a beautiful fixture this game week against Everton with all the injuries coming up it's a gorgeous fixture but just say I could go from him to havit yeah but hit's gonna rise before that's gonna that's the only problem I did think that yeah the people out they attack they're going for him aren't they too quick but um that was another jot and HS will rise because they're cheap right I mean Salas Saka still not everybody can get there no no but jot and uh and in fact let me have a look at FPL statistics now by the time people watch it it may have already happened but J and HS are both set to rise today yeah but you see the thinking you see what I'm getting at do press is to open up the potential for other moves I get and as I've as and as I looked I saw K and Robinson and I thought you know what that should be enough I mean worst case scenario how does play or be it I mean southampton's pictures are actually decent at the moment to be honest but um if I did ever need him but I thought that was comfortable I needed that money in the bank I wanted to keep I was it really annoyed me that Quanto when I saw the price predictions I was like ah I don't need this so early not in game week one but yeah yeah that's the way that's the way it's gone so let me just put it out there I would have held in your position we'll see if you need two new two moves next week I will I will tell you that look the but if you cleverly use your 0.5 next week you can tell me that look I was sensible and I and I saved the 0.1 and now I can upgrade to an A or someone so look I get it there's no one right way it's impossible isn't it it depends how the game pans out it might work in my favor or like you said K Quanza plays and I've lost the the the transfer so I totally agree with you I had to make I made that decision it was a difficult one but with the information I had at the time and I started to just think forward it was it was mainly e actually I was picturing in my head I was like you know what I need to make space have that money in there just in case so that was the Midfield I'll finish off my team up top so San this week PR looks a beautiful uh I know look very good Everton team is dead so yeah it's worth it so I'm happy with that and then the rest is um you know pretty template harand and and isach so harand triple Captain I'm not considering it you know I'm going to wait for for a double I me I know there's been talk about it and it's a a good fixture obviously against C I will say ipswitch first half were very good and if you look at their stats press without the ball the the running the amount of distance they've covered the presses the Sprints incredible but if Liverpool wore you down in the second half man city is the worst team possible to play because no one keeps the ball like them so you're running around like that and if it's a hot day he I can see why people are thinking about it why are are you considering it so it's a bit like Highland and Salah where I started out with nah I'm never going to do that I'm never going to do that then you sleep one night and you go maybe I can do that it would be cool if I did that then you wake W up another night and you go you know it's actually possible and then you wake up another night and uh and then you go yeah I can do it so I'm on the you know it's actually possible type uh of scenario at the moment yeah there's a lot going for him man I mean there's a lot going for him like if you're talking about a scenario so I've already said this on many streams but I'll repeat it because not everybody listens to everything that I do is the problem is there's only two double game weeks this this year right so one one is definitely for bench boost and the other one could be for a free hit or this mystery chip so like whatever the mystery chip it would be beneficial to use it in a double game like unless it's completely random there would be benefits like even if it's a mystery Chip saying double points for Defenders even then you want your Defenders to play TW twice right because you get double points for all of them as compared to you get double points for one more player you would use it in a double game so I think increasingly if you think about it triple Captain will have to be play played in a single game big then if you think harand right completely rested no midweek game um there is no rotation there's no other Striker he can rotate with City are not going to like start resting players because there's nothing there's no Champions League in their mind in the beginning of the Season championship teams are a little bit at least you saw this with I switch right they're a little bit gangho like okay we can do it we can play the same way as we played in the pre in the championship we can play the same way then you get humbled a couple of times and then they become a little bit more pragmatic see Burnley last year yeah so all of those and by the way another one you don't know if you'll own Holland in the next time that there's a juicy fixture right I mean we will try as we've seen you can't own own them all this year you can't own them all there could be Windows where Holland is Holland has a tough fixture before and after a Southampton at home game and then you go maybe I won't have Holland during that period so if you own Holland in this very particular window and the market suggests that his expected points are basically 8.9 I did this math on roby's uh Twitter today yeah I'll put it up now PR just so I'll put it up on the screen because you're right when you look at C's one 3.3 goals and uh usually Holland's share in that is about 50% so you're talking about one and a half goals that he's expected to score one and a half goals roughly six points two appearance points that's eight let's give him a bonus on average so that's nine nine expected points if if if I gave you nine expected points would you triple Captain I think you take it yeah I think you take it you you take it we got 10 last year I think if you if you if I remember correctly in the double game wiek where he got that double early on I think a lot of us had 10 on him were you I think that's a very conservative take it I think a lot of us do dream of the super Halls you know in a double 18 in a double but in a single you got nine is high yeah nine is good you take that yeah and Holland is someone like you said he's goal involvement ratio is one of the best I do sometimes captaincy uh videos and stats and when I was looking at him a lot last year PR he's always like you said in the 30 40% of man City's goals and that you know how high that is very few players last year it was only Salah and son that reached those figures that that you're that involved in everything so when City score he's more than likely gonna be involved you don't really get any other player so I can see why and by the way nine is the median right of like a thousand simulations or thousand times if you plays that's nine expected it could be five it could be two it could be 12 it could be 17 so it's somewhere in the middle right it could still be a hatrick like you never know so I'm just saying it's worth it like like I'm increasingly thinking it could be worth it but the counter to all this is forget about harand this week let's see what the mystery chip is if it needs to be played in a double then just triple Captain someone else later if it's not Holland against Southampton it's Salah against ipswitch it's Salah against leester or it's Saka against Leicester you know like there will be other weeks and ultimately a good triple Captain would be maybe 12:30 if it's all single game week it's all 13 14 points versus 8 n points so maybe that doesn't matter so much anyway so you could just leave it and see how it goes I mean I'm moov you press you're talking to the converted because I've done previously I've used triple captain in single game weeks and it's worked out really well honestly I once I used it on man I think it was a goal and two assists I've used it before yeah I think I as well you done it as well so so I not because I like single game weeks because there was no more weeks left there was no more weeks say that's I was in a similar predicament so my point is of course you've already explained it if the Double's there and it works out nicely we're going to take it the probability is on our side but the reality is if I have to use it in a single game week it will be on Someone Like a Man City Harland versus a promoted team hip switch at the itti had where you're not going to get sniffer the ball like the adrenaline I saw against Liverpool the first half they were excited you know adrine is power powerful they they they they they kept up for 45 minutes the second half you could see in their faces they were like oh van dijk's that big salah's that fast like it hit them they're like oh my goodness and city is going to be even worse they're the worst team to play honestly so nothing wrong with that I'm I'm not considering it yet no PR I know you're saying you you're starting to actually consider it I've not at the moment no I'm not ruling it out now of course a lot of people will watch this and comment no way press is not going to do it they're right because I'm Les I'm more likely to not do it at at as things stand then do it but I'm not ruling it out Saturday morning I can do it I can feel it and I can do it and I'm just letting people know now that it can exactly because the trend again similar to Salah and Holland draft Trend in my mind it's only going little bit up little bit up little so if on Saturday I it it creeps up about 50% maybe I'll do it but I think right now I'm like 30 70 so it's it's still like I'm I'm probably not going to do it but I'm liking the idea more and more the more more I think about it yeah mine's more I'm a lower percentage than you D it take a really big it maybe some news like I don't know IP switch center backs get injured or something like that I don't know but for now no I'm not going to go for it yet see this other other chart by Rob it's not shown here but it's got the odds of him scoring one plus goal is 74% yeah it's massive like it's you know three in four chances that he's going to score one goal the odds of score him scoring two plus goals is 40% so two plus gos 40% huge odds that's hug that's incredible that's incred yeah like I'll tell you what 40% odds are that's for sanii and munis to score this week one goal so the odds of Holland scoring a brace are the same as solanki scoring even one home to Everton or Mone scoring even one home to full the same a it's a special scenario PR we haven't seen a player like a goal scoring machine in a pep team that funnels every chance through him it's just who's going to play 90 minutes no midweek dis exactly take penalties I mean I don't want to you know he's just everything is is in his yeah in his favorite You could argue maybe the the fixture against Leicester will be better I switch maybe a bit more resilient than Leicester that's the thing I I think don't know don't know the scenario we don't know which team is the is the battering team like Leicester did well for one half Southampton did well for arguably the whole game but red card muddy did I switch did really well for one half and then very badly for one half yeah we don't know yet which team is the one that you want to Target so that's a excellent point actually that that's the one thing in my mind that maybe you're jumping the gun too early and then we find out after six game weeks that I switch are legit like that was stupid yeah so fair fair point so I mean anything else on your team any Ben anything else no I think that was the Dilemma to be honest the Smith row and cucko is the big one for me that that's the ultimate since after I've made the transfer I'm pretty comfortable set on this team there's there's not much else week for me I'm I'm happy with the tri triple Newcastle [Applause] okay hey guys thank you for watching fantasy football scouts deadline dilemmas ahead of gameweek 2 um just a quick two-minute promo with Giani from our video sponsors fan team in this quick promo we're going to introduce their big pick six weekly uh Premier League format Fantasy game um in this game you pick six players uh and that you can pick six players in any position maximum from Maximum of three from one Club um and this week we've got three games to pick from wolves Chelsea Bournemouth Newcastle and Liverpool brenford you've got a limited budget and there's a safety net in place if your player doesn't start he he will be replaced at kickoff by someone from the same team and same position uh it cost just2 pound to enter there's a guaranteed 75,000 prize pool and the top 20% of finishers get paid so it's a really good opportunity to win to win some money in gameweek two um and what we're going to do with Johnny is we are going to bring up the scout team which I'll read out for those in the podcast uh that is Trent Palmer and kungu Salah J and isach so Giani who who you looking at on the Sunday to Target I love this it's proper Super Sunday Vibes uh like you enter and within a few hours you'll know how you got on rather than the whole set of weekend long game so I'm all for this game um obviously so it's Max three per team if I could go six Liverpool players I probably would um the three Liverpool you can't argue with the names you've gone for like Trent Salah J double Chelsea more I don't know Tom I guess you put this this team together from from Scout you're a Chelsea fan so am I I think I probably go double Newcastle over double I go Gordon and isach maybe instead of palman and kungu but yeah I mean it looks good of course you've got to cover the three team who've just mentioned yeah what about maybe a blanket defense as a strategy do you like that yeah I don't mind that and again some some some games you look at stacking you could in this one too um it's just only having triple Liverpool isn't it the defense you'd want to back most is probably Liverpool and then you can't have double attack so yeah it's an interesting one picking do you commit to double defense or double attack but Liverpool are clearly the big win team here we think and under slot they've got a little bit more control they're they're going to keep more clean sheet they might score a fewer goals they're going to keep more clean sheets I think yeah so just quickly if people are looking obviously trying to win maybe need to go a little bit differential if you got a differential from each of the big clubs you could maybe point out I wonder I mean look if we if we were to get team news here that Pedro Netto is starting against his old club like that's quite exciting for Chelsea fans but also against wolves like there's something in that narrative and then at Newcastle yeah like obviously Jacob Murphy will feel like he's owed something had an amazing preseason but then he was the sacrificial lamb as as Fabian sha was sent off so is there a bit of narrative there to go like okay Jacob Murphy is going to get a start this week we'll know if he's starting now in the 2:00 game could you Chuck him in maybe he's red hot preseason yeah and then I guess from Liverpool maybe sparlight or Diaz as well could be interesting there yeah I love Spotlight six point well it's 65 my FPL team but um yeah Diaz is always fun Diaz is obviously more attacking there again if he doesn't start you get a replacement but no soot I think has a has has way more goal thre this season playing in the 10 yeah for sure so it's that simple it's six players it's no budget um max three from any club and it's just the Sunday fixtures this week uh so something as Giani says to keep you entertained during Super Sunday this is of course 18 plus uh be gamble aware and always play responsibly but yeah check out the link in the description the fan team big pick six game uh is live now and now we're going going to go back to deadline dilemas ahead of FPL game week 2 [Applause] okay then I can go to my team then I guess yeah let's go to your team so Henderson in Gold similar to you Trent Hall and Robinson we're on the same back four uh I'm also on Gordon I'm also on zot I've got Smith row instead of unu of yours and I've got Salah instead of who do you have uh Bruno Bruno that that I like that upgrade um but then obviously I don't I don't have sanki I have jao Pedro and have Holland and esack so that's my team um obviously I'm rolling I had no no issues I mean Barco was the minor issue I think it's been cleared up like Neil had this you know like it's everyone is discussing oh it could be this it could be this it could be this Neil comes up with here are the last 50 loans that have happened in the league and none of them changed in price so everyone's like okay shush it won't change um so if the moment he's red flagged his price won't change and I'm looking at FPS statistic he's not even close to a drop so there's no chance I'm doing any strange of things have happened o you never know I mean when are they going to Red Flag him and people might start panicking because there are people that might want to actually use him and as the game we creeps up is you know the game we creeps up you never know good luck to them if they want to use their valuable transfer on a 4.0 Defender best of luck you can tell that I'm sour with my Quanza moves I don't mind if this happens with Barco that's the reason I'm thinking that even OD it can drop tomorrow and I'll have zero regrets like I'll have regrets that why did it drop but I'm not doing anything I'm not it because next week I have some spicy moves like I could go isack up to Watkins with a Gordon down to E I could go um you know I could even go harand down to Watkins and Smith up to Palmer or foden like there's lots of moves I could go J let's say jot misses the next game or yeah you know he gets injured jot down to Min Robinson up to Robertson like I feel like two moves are going to be very powerful next week now I'm not rubbing it in for people who you rubb don't worry you are right look yeah you could do the two moves in three weeks uh so it's not the end of the world or I could take a minus four but yeah I don't want to do that obviously honestly hits are going to be very very costly this year like it's still four points but in in Prior years with more double game weeks you could take 10 15 hits in a year and and it would be okay I think if you're taking three to if you're taking over five hits this year it's going to be detrimental it could be yeah it really could I'm going to be here every Thursday talking you out of taking a hit if that's the one thing I do is to calm you down and to stop you taking a hit yeah I'm not really like hit crazy I think last season I didn't take too much hits but there are there are times I think where it needs to be done pres even of what you said circumstances obviously you're playing against people that have got transfers banked and they're going to pay be more more detrimental to our teams but I do think when there's a time to do it it's got to be done I'm hoping next week I could maybe even roll and then I'm back in like you said to transfers and whatnot so exactly yeah but your team looking at your team Pedro surprised me his minutes because there was a lot if I thought he'd played that much I would have possibly gone day inoz but I was I wasn't too sure of him he missed all of preseason played one game scored that stun up of course and then all of a sudden straight back into the team and played really well as well so played well and and there was this wellbe interview he was talking about his chemistry with jedro so look I think I'm I'm happy with his minutes um obviously next week he goes to the bench and Rogers starts um because Villa have a good fixture against Leicester and he plays Arsenal so that's the rotation I had in mind basically a villa Brighton kind of rotation um and uh we'll see how that works out but uh will he be available for me to play in gim big four and five when Brighton's fixtures are really really good I hope so I really hope so even though this signed Rutter um I hope that he's somebody who I can rely on because I want him like I I need this team to carry me through to game week five because the plan is a game week six while card and so these guys both Villa and and Brighton were the teams I was backing for game week four and five already Barco has gone you know Rogers could go away and then suddenly for four and five I need to do two or three transfers to actually make it better but uh that's fine if I have to do that I will do that I think after that performance PR I think he he's okay for this game we unless an injury I know they've got luxuries of attackers as well and we're still learning a lot about the manager but I think that's a nice partnership and Welbeck played so well he's another 5.5 million if he could stay yeah honestly the Finish brilliant but yeah I think you're you're good with Pedro the reason I mentioned him at one stage I thought that might be when I saw your game we one team I for all that could be a risk there but it's looking like he actually a good pick at the moment so my my team on a Friday morning which I discussed on my I think with you as well had had e instead of Gordon and mun instead of Xiao Pedro it did surprise me when I see the change yeah well but that that's I had to do it because there was all this thing on you know a is more likely to leave than not and things like that and I was like you know screw it I don't want e to be leaving and then I have to deal with an e um so I I regret it like right now if I had e home to West Ham and mun home to leester in this team I would say man that's a great team right now but I had to make that little change and I had to get Gordon who I don't like man I mean last last season he was the one player you know when when you get they don't score when you don't have they keep scoring he was that to me so uh I wasn't too happy keep the faith he's he's a good player I think he returns this um this week I know last year the statistics were heavily weighed at home and away he was yeah so in fies against us this week but yeah I'm confident something there's a good player there and next week they're home to Spurs right and I'm happy with that like Spurs don't like going to St James's Park like it's tough and the word the way Spurs play PR I mean we discussed this a little bit in game week one the way they empty the wide positions with poron nudi I mean you saw less should have scored did you see where V you should have won the game that was poral position por if you're playing against Spurs and you're a wide guy you should be licking your lips cuz they just they just say hey you go help yourself so long as you transition quick enough it's a weird style of football but fair Place frontf footed and very aggressive but I could see Gordon there my goodness yeah that that's a real good fixture good point good point I mean one thing about your team then per is there anything you see that you're you're batting against this game week that worries you obviously you can't cover everything you're not making transfers every week but y um uh Arsenal in general so Arsenal away to Villa is not an easy game but they could win 2-n Saka could score score a 10-pointer and and and the Arsenal Defenders still get uh a clean sheet so I think going against Arsenal not easy but then my logic is now Arsenal have three away games the three tough away games so yeah they're not going to keep three clean sheets in that I'm confident enough of that like okay I can eat my words but I'm confident um it's it's it's absolutely fine so we'll see and and of course lastly I'm going against City defense which a lot of us are yeah switch looks like a good clean sheet fixture I think that's a clean sheet fixture but did you see Arsenal's performance wasn't the best against wolves so you can take that both both ways these threeway fixtures are going to be extra tricky because they might not be in gear but also if you're winning two- nil when not playing well tells you what what what quality team they are and I reckon they do turn up they possibly keep two cleans in those three press so they could still hurt us cuz we we're non-owners they could they could and that's fine by game week six I'll have three of them so it's not a problem and Captain C did you not even even slightly consider Salah not even a little bit PR you've considered the triple Captain yeah no chance no no no chance I mean I'm not saying Salah is not going to do well but it's not even closed like Highland a wait Highland at home to switch is at least 1.5 times better than Salah home to okay maybe that's too much but yeah I think Salah is good Holland is exceptional you don't need to go against if you have Holland you don't need to overthink it at all yeah I did see the the the graph that sky sport showed regarding U how much goals he scored and it's like almost double Salas goals like 91 to is it 46 or something it's crazy so yeah it's hard to get against to argue against that but I think you're you're set up in a good position I'm hoping this week if Bruno does something if Bruno matches Salah then I'm hoping to be a on more points than you this game week that's that's the Hope because we are not competing more we are just facilitating of course I'm not using I would love for Bruno to get a a brace you know it's a win-win for you that's how I took that's how I took salah's points last week these ones didn't bother me as much as saker's ones because obviously Saka Arsenal salah's ones I'm like yeah go on then you can have them I mean this this is how my week transpired right I mean first Salah hold and then I'm like what it decision Salah instead of Saka here we go and then obviously Saka gets his double return and I'm like it's fine I guess you know Salah still outscored by two points so you know the sequence sometimes plays with our mind as well which it shouldn't it should what in fact actually while I've got you I know you're a United fan what do you expect from United versus Brighton like uh 2-1 to either side or a one all something like that or even a 22 like I think both oh actually yeah that's a good point let's look at that yeah 1.5 1. 1.6 1.6 so very similar like it could be 22 it could be 1 one something like that and I'm asking these questions selfishly for me I've got Bruno does he play in that that false nine him and mount sort of sharing it or is xery I think that's how you pronounce his name is he going to start I prefer Bruno facing the game because he's passing is unreal so I'm I think it'll be the case like it's so far I think xeri again comes on 30 you know 50th minute or 60th minute but uh I do expect garnacho to start start this one instead of a mud so anyone who has a mud should probably sell um or bench so that's uh that's all by the way maresa has said that he's fine Palmer is fine so Inu back on your bench yeah Inu go back on the bench I think I think ESR has to get the run out now if if we're here next week and Inu score two goals honestly not sure I'll be able to handle it I have I I take no blame I in fact let me end it with go with your gut that is the best yeah no I the moment yeah no I think so PR yeah I'm comfortable with that decision I'm I'm going to just commit to it I think at the moment is of ESR because of the Leicester fixture and the expected minutes I'm going to give it to him cool let's leave it there let's see what other spanners are thrown in the Friday press conferences but hopefully this gives you a good idea of where we are at and some of the key decisions we're making which hopefully are similar to the ones that you're making uh we will try to do this on Thursday nights and have them to you on Friday sometimes we'll do a THS night stream once yeah once we get a little bit more comfortable with the hosting but uh we appreciate your support there was uh some good comments in the last video so appreciate it always every good comment we read and we really really appreciate it so thank you more Last Words thank you very much please like all the videos and as PR said get in the comment so let us know any other things you want to discuss cheers bye-bye [Music] [Applause]",10611

you're all doing well ahead of the gameweek 2 deadline and you all had great seasons and as you can see from the screen we're counting any score you got as a green arrow it's Sun fair in it s i mean unless you'll last but otherwise yes you got green arrow do you reckon there's any chance that the person in last is listening to this stream no well if they were if they were they wouldn't be last for much longer exactly or something you last to First that would be a claim to fame for us would would be yeah we could we could put that if you are last and listening to the stream get in touch because we want to see if we can get you we won't imagine if we did imagine if they were last this week they listen to us and then next week they're first you and I will be loving it well there's the there's the anti FPL isn't there where you know you deliberately pick players who who don't who don't score so if you had share Captain for example his minus points and I don't know other players who don't score it's uh yeah different ways different ways to play the game uh hello to everyone welcome uh to FB uproar who said they're going to get grab a coffee that was a few minutes ago wish done that yeah I've got I've got a water yeah I've got a water I didn't I just got off a call and I didn't have time to go and remake my tea so I've got no tea oh that's very sad very sad uh hi to Vegeta who says the main question is whether we'll get a black box this week we will indeed there'll be one tonight uh Mark is slacking with the thumbnail not sure why it's his job but it is apparently and is Madison your bad boy again good performance from him I thought have you been have you been listening to the official pod Madison was my differential of the week this week was he lovely lovely he's back he's back he's back in my affectionate good books I thought played really well on Monday night yeah he was great yeah yeah he was great trust John says Sam what happened to Spurs on Monday complete dominance in the first half and then what do you mean what happened that's just standard Spurs yeah it was very spursy wasn't it yeah we were brilliant in the first half didn't take our chances which was why is the light just come behind me whoa that's creepy it's very like alien as well what the hell the remote is over there X Files as the remote is literally across the across the room hang on look Y yellena is calling me which is nice I'm so confused at what just happened fortunately you know we're live so we are live just just answer and go sorry we're live that was so bizarre up and then uh anyway yes so Spurs on Monday night maybe it's because I was about to slag off Spurs the light of Doom came on it was warning warning warning warning Sam's about to run um yeah I don't know we played really well in the first half we didn't take our chances apart from porro and then the second half it was like we had one Mo we we playing all right we had one moment where we just clearly forgot that we were supposed to to defend and then their heads went for about 25 minutes the only the only positive thing I can say is the the Benton core I mean it was horrific as a Benton cor fan I was like oh my God this is awful I don't want to watch but then it actually just killed it killed Lester's momentum and then after that we were better but I don't know what happened to Spurs they just did spursy things so we'll see what happens on Saturday I guess I mean porro scored a striker goal but your other your other attackers I thought sank had a couple of half chances nothing amazing but well I don't know maybe could have done better I thought sanki had a decent first game given it was his first game I thought he was decent he had three attempts all of them on target yeah I thought he was all right I thought Madison play I was getting I was getting to he was fine sa and Johnson I thought were awful yeah I thought Madison played well I mean and what was really interesting for me is that Madison there were 13 corners from Spurs in that game Madison took 12 of them bfield took one when he came off the bench but then Madison wasn't on the pitch by that point and there were four four free kicks of which Madison took all three that he was on the pitch for so when I was watching the game I was thinking oh this is really interesting because he's even taking the corners on parro's side now whereas before they at the end of last season when Madison was coming back they were sharing them whereas on Monday night they did there was no sharing Madison was like that's mine I'm on it and actually did a good job with them I thought the set pieces were were generally good from Spurs on Monday which is unusual for us by the way um but yeah and then I just I thought he so I thought Madison was good he had it was only some that had more touches in the final third than um than Madison from a Spurs perspective I thought he was good I thought porro was good but then sun was so wide that just felt from an FPL perspective really out of it the one thing I would say though is that we are about to play Everton so if you're a son owner given that it's Ashley Young side of the pitch that some will be on they now don't have someone to play in that position whole gate isn't it but then they haven't tarkovski is out as well tarkovski is out as well so surely Holgate is more in the tarkovski position though I don't know who else can play at right back if it's I have no idea but that's that's the son Madison side because Madison tends to go left rather than right so when I'm looking at the team for Saturday I'm like surely actually if you've got sun he becomes a decent option I I thought he was poor um well that takes us on to our our first question which is from flanny boy 1888 uh I have one question hopefully it can be answered it can because I'm going to answer it right now should I swap son for foden No Man City players advice pie I spoke to Lee about this on Off the Bench and he was adamant that he wouldn't sell son ahead of this week but I mean I can completely see the appeal of selling son for fob given it zip switch but like you say it's son versus an unknown entity and D saying they've only got 14 fit players today as well when you think about that 14 fit players I think the three that be on the bench won't be Defenders I don't think they have three Defenders to go on the bench so when I'm looking at that Everton team and who might play at Spurs on Saturday lunch or Saturday afternoon genuinely I'm like struggling to work out who defends for Everton in that game particularly down Sunside and it's our first home game of the season and actually when you obviously the the benefits of being a Spurs fan in these moments is that obviously I follow every Spurs Channel when every Spurs player going they are angry they they feel annoyed about what happened on Monday night you can tell that from their the tweets that they're putting out on their social media posts so I would expect to bounce back in that first home game and therefore that would put me off selling son the issue I have with this person here is the No Man City because it's zip switch at home and there really isn't like a better there won't be very many better fixtures than that for Manchester City this season um so when you're thinking about selling sun to move to a city player I I I sort of get that like although I see the appeal of sun I do also see the appeal of going for a city asset the one issue I have is do I'm not entirely sure who gets the ND for Man City like you'd think that foden starts given he played 45 minutes in game week one I would expect him to get the start would wouldn't you oh yeah I'm I'm pretty sure Fen starts I I wouldn't be too about that it might it might be minutes managed though play he play 45 didn't in the last game but I'd be surprised to see him get the full full 90 well you're sitting on the fence no I for answer I'd hold I'd hold son on the basis of what happened today in the press conferences I think if you'd have asked me yesterday I'd have said I'd do the swap but today on what Sean D has been saying in in the Press about having no players I think i' keeps on for this week I'd sell him would you I think so I think if you if you've ear Mark son to foden the only thing that's changed is the Young's availability and young isn't a good Defender anyway so I don't think it's going to be any worse whoever comes in at right back so I don't think much has has changed I'm just saying if you've always if that's what you if you got some for one week to switch to fotus I don't think there's any new information that really make me I don't think some played particularly well I think there was always going to be a weakness down Everton's right hand side anyway and if you're going to make the switch to phone to Target the switch game there's no real like right or wrong answer is there because it's it's just a case of who would you rather have this week son or foden both obviously great options I still think IP switch at home is a better fixture and I expect I would expect City to score more goals than Spurs overall but it's yeah I mean it's close I do it you say not to there you go it's tight though it is tight soan says young the Forever Young Defender he didn't look very young against matoma he looked he looked his age I'm not going to lie it was yeah that was always going to be he's older than me I think isn't he and and I couldn't play 90 minutes of professional football I mean I don't think I is he 37 37 30 I've got 39 in my head but that too that feel young9 in my head I'm going to Google it oh yeah me too he's had 399 he's I thought do you know what I thought he was 39 but as I was as I was saying I was like he can't be 39 and starting in the isue July the 9th 1985 fair play fair play to him there's not many players that could still be playing it it feels like he's been around forever and well he has though yeah I I don't know if he's going to come back I mean he might have to because they hav't got any players but I think if they saw him trippy that's could be could be it yeah but don't think that just rules trippier out of being picked in FPL who's going to pay 6 million for an Everton Defender God no way no no way absolutely not but it does open up for um liento at Newcastle that's true um lemon says as a city fan not sure foden starts I think there's enough I do think there's enough doubt there I think he starts but I wouldn't be like normally I'm like I'm I'd be 95 I'm like 80% sure foden start yeah yeah I guess so it's it's ipswitch like he really should be out of play not not risk fod him for 60 minutes he should be able to they're they're short on players aren't they like he had to he he came on he came on I think I don't think he would have got 45 minutes if s got hadn't got injured um yeah I mean you'll be gutted if if you do sell son then F doesn't doesn't start I'd still I'd still do it though uh a doggy looks like a cheaper porro alternative what do you think of that no I don't I it's five five saving like I don't think it's enough like when you watch that game on Monday night porro is the is the defender of choice if you want a Spurs Defender you go porro because we won't keep clean sheet I've been saying that for ages like we just don't we're not solid defensively we we'll keep some but we won't keep many um if you really want a cheap one then you can go for vaner Shaw but I just think that with UD dogs he's going to get some UD dos yeah he's GNA get some he'll get some attacking returns but I don't think he'll get anywhere near the attacking returns that porro will get this season I don't think there's in it between him and vanen you doggy yeah I'd rather have vanen over yeah exactly that's what I mean I don't think there's much in it I think I'd rather just just go just go vanin Um I agree we saw last year I mean AD DOI gets into some very very good positions he's a very he's a very good player but he's not really getting the returns whereas vanen gets into less good positions but when he does he seems to be able to find the find the backer there I don't think much in it between them if you're going to spend 5 million on a Spurs Defender I would go for Romero over you doggy yeah yeah exactly yeah he I mean he was taking up some great positions again against against Leicester yeah he he I went for him over porro at the end of last season though that didn't go very well yeah that didn't go very well uh we're getting loads of questions thanks to everyone keep them coming in do jobs with super chat if you're definitely want your question answered otherwise I'm just going to grab some at random uh Greg Frost says match of the day challenge is going to be awesome FB Black Box Saturday yeah Mark and I doing match challenge he's coming up up to Hitchin uh I think with Billy as well a he's bringing Billy think it's gonna be yells and Billy downstairs and me and Mark up here watching watch match today so yeah do tune in to that if you're if you're interested uh Daniel says if I can't get attack thanks Sam uh if I can't get City attack is it worth it to sell porro for vardal oh no sorry I've been watching Premier League pronunciations is gardio you do pronounce the G I've got to start doing that gardio double up on defense double up on double up on City defense that's interesting who's the other one do you reckon Rico Rico Lewis and gardio Edison Edison yeah I mean I don't think too many people started with with Edison but yeah Daniel let us know who your other City Defender is doesn't really matter but what do you think of the double defense I don't like anyone in that City defense other than other than gardio nor do I I wouldn't I wouldn't i' be looking at a Ki but I'd rather have porro for this week alongside B than I would think he's all right you think por will start I think he trained today cuz that picture of his ankle with a tattoo on it is that the one you've seen no there was a um there's a there's a been a few Spurs videos and I was like trying to see see if I saw him because but and there's one where I'm pretty sure it's him but I can't he doesn't turn around it's the back of his head and I was looking at the boots and I was like I think there's a Po's boots like this is how seriously I was taking them but you know but but you also know that P KLU is one of the most honest ones so if we's asked then he will be asked about porro he will tell the truth he's fine mate he's fine and if he says he's fine then you know he's going to start because we haven't got anyone else sold we sold Royale yeah poor Posta goler he looked he looked broken after that that honestly that moment picture of him just like Flor did you watch the game live because honestly when Sky cut to him charlan does that header and it's like what are you doing mate what what are you doing and then in slow motion POA kogu just just descends to his knees and and it's honestly the funniest thing I've ever seen because it's like it's almost like he's like oh Richie mate and he just like collapses and he's just standing there with his hands on his knees he was such a happy fellow this time a year ago that's what happens being a SP fan or Spurs manager honestly but it was really funny to watch because I was just like he basically did what I did I I sort of ins when richardis when the ball went to richardis and I was like and then I cut has basically done the same thing or quality but yeah disappointing we're getting some questions about about porro so would you do porro to Robertson or roll in play Harwood Bellis um Luke say say per back in training just wait for the team news um it's it's hard to comment if if porro is out I will probably have to take him out of my team because I've got Barco who we can talk about in a bit that's your fault and Ben Johnson who a didn't start against Liverpool and B is playing away at at man City so I think i' I'll have to which is why I was looking at a Ki cuz I can't I can't go I can't go to cardio cuz I don't have the extra5 and then it's who else in the in the attack and in the defense and Rico Lewis is popular but I think there's people going from qua to to Lewis and I'm thinking that's just one would not surprise me the start yeah 100% um so I've got porro and but I've got the most ridiculous by for some reason I've gone big at the back haven't I so I've got vardal celba and porro and then I've also got Robinson and then Barco I'm guessing you were planning on benching celba right CBA was it Gabrielle can't which said no I've got CA no so I was actually planning to play a back four this week oh okay interesting so my plan was to play a back four and to bench enu oh God you're that stage with enu already you're benching for a Arsenal player a Wyatt Villa that seems I already regret My Life Choices um oh dear I'm already at that point where I'm like no I don't I'm done with you I don't like you anymore um so if porro is out it's actually fine I'll just playing Kung yeah so I'm not like I don't have to make a change what I would say is that I think both Robinson and I think car Bellis was mentioned wasn't he both of them have good fixtures moving forward like both of them have an opportunity for some clean sheets in the next few weeks and I do think that Barco to Harwood Bellis actually does make a lot of sense I very nearly started with Harwood Bellis and I wish I had I think I got two caught up in the corner thing at Brighton and I was just like o taking Corners who have you been listening to you know well my mate is a bit of an idiot but I'm joking but I think I think Barco was the obvious logical choice because he was on corners and the route to points was there if the clean sheets didn't stick whereas with Bellis it's just one of those things right I think um bani says it it great as as B didn't start last week because he was bound for a lone move I think that's probably what happened I I actually think is is a strange one because obviously everyone he looked so nailed on to to start um and if you look at our other players a lot of other players it's dingra matoma cedo all these players went out on loan yeah had a year out and then came back and we kind of straight in the first team whereas it's been quite clear with Barco he's been integrated in the first team straight away you know pre-season not not loaned out in preseason it just looked like he was going to be a first team player for us I thought he' kind of bypassed the loan bit so I wasn't really too worried about that um as soon as he missed out in game Atek one though I thought there's an injury here or there's a loan there's a coming it felt that didn't it like when I was texting you on Saturday when that team Sheet came out I was like I've got I've got a text out so in our group chat I was like it's got to be some uh I like to find a gift that I can't remember which one I sent now but I sent you oh I sent you one about being a fraud didn't I thanks you the only one no I bet it wasn't but actually in my head I was like well it is what it is like it's your four like I was just jesting with you like in reality it's your four million Defender so you know whatever yeah it's much worse you for quono and who exactly yeah I mean there's definitely one expert in Black Box and uh you know uh so I'm looking at it and I'm like okay well it's not the end of the world but if you can go to Har Bellis I don't think that that's a bad idea the Southampton fixture is actually all right and I'd play him this week yeah I would play him this week like I would play him this week if I had bis like i' I don't know how to play five at the back but but I genuinely think he's a decent option this week and is a decent option over the coming weeks as well so if you are in a quandry where you've got problems and you're not sure what to do and you're worried about hor then a Harwood Bellis for Barco I think is a a really good option yep uh Thomas W says thoughts on a slanky captain now that Everton's defense is so weak I'm guessing if you're a har owner then you're going to be going there but if you're not a Harland owner yeah you're either going I mean you're going to go Salah I imagine but sanki isn't a bad alternative is he no I think that I like it's weird isn't it because you're going to go Harlem because you know if you've got him that's what you're doing you you've bought him for this week but when you actually look at the fixtures for this week if you've got Salah or jotter either of them are Captain a b this week if you've got Sun even I would still keep signing this bracket son or salanki or Madison they are captaincy options this week like there are genuinely good options across the league so I actually quite like the salanki captain thing like if I didn't have Harden I think that's what I would do I would go outside the box and try to find a player that's got potential to return well and against an an Everton defense that I don't think might may not have any Defenders in it then salanki who got three shots on Target and has 90 minutes of play with his new teammates under his belt now so understands a little bit more about what balls I thought he fitted in really well to the Spurs system in the first half I was watching it and I was like hello there was one moment where he pressed he pressed the ball and I turned to Lee who was sitting next to to me and I was like what is this there's a Spurs number nine on the pitch and he's pressing the ball and he's and he's getting back and he's winning tackles and he's up and he's in the box and I don't understand what's happening but I was impressed Enough by salanki that's I think that's what I'm saying so I actually don't mind the salanki captain if you don't have Harem yeah I I don't mind it either um I would still go Salah I think against brenford but I think I probably would too but I don't don't you think like if you've not got the obvious one then going for someone a bit road yeah no I I I I don't hate it I don't hate it at all um the flip side of this is if you do have oh my voice hang on are you all right no don't choke some dust I think don't do that that would taste nice come on if you're going to eat on the stream get some chocolate or something I wish I wish I had something to Harland triple captain from Baris 302 Nathan Kelly triple Captain Harland and Rory Harland triple Captain what do you guys reckon his EO is going to be high very high it could even be over 200% because I think we're going to see a lot of triple captains on him this week or is it just people saying they're going to do it don't do it well there are a lot of triple captains active there's over 300,000 of them active right now that's a lot but you can cancel it but you can cancel it but will you I mean it's not injured so why would you start it and then cancel it you would not in this boat I think in some cases you do but in this circumstance I think probably people won't so let's say we're go into this game with with 300,000 triple captains active on Haren that will hurt if you own him and you've captained him it's going to hurt I think there will be more than 300,000 I think there will too I think there will too I think we'll be at more like 450,000 triple captains this week on him well he's he's what 50% owned mhm so that's how many people how many people 9 million so he's owned by 4 and a half million yep so yeah if 10% of those Captain him that' be 450k so yeah I can I can see that yeah that's where I think we'll land yeah my honest thoughts and I'm prepared to be shut down on this is that I'm not doing it and I the reason I'm not doing it is actually nothing to do with Haren because he's come out and said he's in great form and he's ready to go and all that stuff and to be fair he looks it right I was he looks fully fit and you know strong and everything else my issue is Man City m and it's not really because I don't think Man City are good because clearly I do and they won the game on Saturday but I just look at that team and I think in three or four weeks time that man City team is so much stronger than it is right now because it's got its stars back and they've got match Fitness from being out over the summer and the break that they've had I'm not sure what that man city team's going to look like on Saturday I'm not sure who starts with any certainty like I can't look at that team and go foden and Roger and all the these guys definitely get the start like I don't feel confident saying that so that puts me off the triple Captain because I want my triple Captain to be a player ideally that's in form and playing for a team at full strength and in flowing form and I don't feel I can say that about Man City right now which is why I've decided not to do it because I genuinely think that you know in in a few week when Southampton or um well anyone really but when when one of the other newly promoted sides turn up at thead in a few weeks time that could be just as good a game week to do it and City might be in that form that's why I'm not yeah I I completely agree with all of that I mean what there's there's a there's a thing in the back of my mind which is do I really want to be using a chip this early anyway we we think there's going to be less double game weeks going forward but you never know what might happen a bit later on games have been called off for all kinds of different reasons we might double game week exactly we might end up with a great double game down the line we also don't know what this mystery chip is and whe we can use that in conjunction with with the triple Captain somehow I mean I don't know how that would work but you know maybe maybe we can like dovetail the two we've got unknowns about Man City because rodri is not there and it's difficult to judge them on a on a you know a away game at Chelsea where they were okay they won the game 2-0 and they played well but they didn't I thought Chelsea could have nicked a goal in that and then it might a different game the chances are they play at home to whip switch they win four or five nil and Harland gets two goals I I would I would be surprised if that didn't happen but stranger things have happened in the past and I completely agree I I want to see a full I mean harand scored big in you know got a brace in his first game in the league against West Ham he got hattricks against Forest you know in gam like five or game four or five or something like that like you know City might start a little bit slowly but harand seems to start pretty strongly hasn't ever scored in gameweek two though has he I think I'm right in saying that he has he not I think I'm right in saying that is there any is there anything you can take from that though no absolutely not of course not but and you could argue that he hasn't scored a game two but he's never really been fully fit going into a season like he is he is now yeah but then he's returned 13 and 13 in the last two gameweek ones before this one I also think it's it is tricky playing a promoted team early on also as if IP switch come like honestly and I'm prepared to be shot down on this as well but I was really impressed by IP switch in that first half against Liverpool I know that they were at home and living on Vibes and just the feel of the crowd and all of that stuff I get all of that but genuinely they played well they ran out of path Liverpool came out after some changes to their personnel at halftime um and played much much better in the second half but I was impressed by it Swit in that first half now if you are ipswitch your first away match in the Premier League is going to the etad you're living on Vibes again aren't you and it's and it's don't get thrashed that's the message the message is don't lose 6 nil if we lose two or 3 nil we suck it up we've played Liverpool and City we haven't embarrassed ourselves 100% we push on from there we fill them at home in the next game yeah I agree I totally agree like I don't genuinely think that there is I which proved on Saturday that they can be resilient they can they did it for 60 Minutes against Liverpool and then they had a little bit of a collapse but they only lost by two they didn't get stuffed they will want to repeat that performance again against Man City and I don't know that there's a better game for them and in terms of away trips anyway that this will be one that they they'll are marked on their calendars like oh you know we're off to the EAD and they're coming up against a Man City team that aren't fully ready yet they're good obviously because it's City but they haven't got all their star boys back yet and that all of that noise now he could still go and bang a hat-trick but I also would put on him banging a hattrick in gameweek 10 game week 11 game week 12 unities isn't there and and we don't know what state Southampton might be in in like game week whatever they play them we don't know what state Leicester will be in things sign any players I think there's going to be other if you think that that pep sets City up and they go out and they absolutely batter rip switch five or six nil and you've ear marked the triple Captain I'm not going to say anything to change your mind on it I think it's it's harand versus newly promoted side at home he's a great option there might not be a better chance and we might be completely wrong but for me I want to I want to keep it for a bit longer I'm with you also as it will ruin my season if I get if I get a captaincy fail in game week two I'm like raging and and honestly I'm going to get to Christmas and I'm still going to be in the only reason I'm a bit tempted to do it is because Mark hasn't got him and we're doing match of day challenge imagine if I triple captained him oh as please I don't I honestly because I will know what's happened and I'm not sure that I could watch you live that trauma with much of the day no I mean imagine the Elation though if if I I would be I would get called so many smug names if I if I troll captain and Mar didn't have him the last time I watched you two do a match day challenge it was honestly one of the that was when it all the best and the worst things yeah it was honestly one of the best and the worst things I've ever watched in my life that was the 9 nil wasn't it was that n there with s it was it was the one where you knew that something big had gone off cuz the audience was huge yeah and I remember mark saying to you Something's Happened because there's like 9,000 people no no that no that wasn't the last one was that the one before that was the one before that's when that's when s blank in a 90 and harand got hat-trick and that's right that's right that was that one and but honestly I like I because we're friends I genuinely feel it like when you're doing it I'm like oh my God and I don't think I could cope knowing that you triple Captain when you log in and you see like five 6 thousand people watching and we don't get that many views normally so you're like well something's happened and people like misery yeah they do they do and you know that that's why people turn up people turn up to watch you suffer yeah um I mean bit of a mixed bit of a mixed bag um rather triple Captain H see a firing second half of the Season says Stuart b62 that's what uh Sam and I have been saying um Jason limb says sity you're going to hammer rip switch they probably will if you think that then then go for it Malaki says Harden is getting a hattick I assume if you think that then you C Captain him absolutely I think it's a bit difficult uh hero doses was on the fence he says got a run don't know if we've actually helped him in that whatsoever but we we tried we tried uh Jason M says you say swi only lost two nil but Liverpool batter them in the second half it could have been 5 nil the ex was nearly four and Liverpool wasted opportunities that's true that's not untrue that is true but I just I honestly think that do you think that this man City team is better than the Liverpool team that we saw last week not right now exactly and so that and that's where I am is that I think the Liverpool team right now with the Personnel that they have available are better than the Man City team that we've got right now I'm not saying that's how it's going to be all season because Man City clearly when they've got everyone there are epic but right now that's where I think we are with those two teams I triple Captain har in a single game week and pep subbed him at halftime that was against Bournemouth last year wasn't it I remember that yeah yeah I remember that oh oh pain uh Co bugler says game week four versus Fulham last season Harland yeah he was he was pretty poor I remember going into that game as well there's lots of question marks about whether we we should pay all the money need him yeah yeah and then he obviously got the hatrick in in that uh Peta says as accidental trible Captain confirmed no you got to confirm it now they've changed it it's not going to happen again it's beautiful uh Idis says what about Qua we talked about porro we've talked about Barco what about qua he's dropped now though in there you the hell did you sell him for you have to sell him for 4 million you have to go to Harwood Bellis you have to go to Har Bellis yeah he's come up a lot Greaves or gaves I actually quite like Greaves after this week not this week but next week if you want a player that plays this week you got to go hard with Bellis if you want a player from next week then you can go for Greaves um You probably just leave him now though don't you unless unless you haven't got another Defender like you should have probably made that move a few days not very helpful of hindsight but no because like I was doing the official pop with KS this morning and she's got quano and Barco and I'm just like well you got a problem now haven't you because she's got problem no she's got another problem as well no she doesn't have porro because she was raging that Joes and I both did as well oh no that doesn't sound like a very Kelly thing to do but she's or maybe it's a player that she doesn't want to play this week and and coner maybe at home to Arsenal possibly yeah it could possibly and I'm and I was looking at it or possibly it's Anderson oh yeah problematic it might be that's an annoying one for people was not expecting that move no well I sort of was expecting that move which is why because I had Anderson for quite a long time that's why I took him out because it started coming out of this rumor didn't it just before game we one um where was I going with this if you have to I think there are plenty of people that have conza that are going to have to deal with him because I don't think you can keep him now because canate is always going to be there now the fact that slot is happy to go this isn't working I'm taking you off at half time is quite telling and I think there'll be some starts but like Lee was saying this before like that's why Lee didn't go for him because he was like it's too risky there's always going to be a canate shaped problem in the rearview mirror if you are a k Quanza owner and now I feel like it's K Quanza is the problem in the rearview mirror because canate surely having been the one that comes on and then they go on to win the game is the one that gets the start this time around well Kelly's got moscara at foron the Wolves Defender I'd probably just play him against Chelsea I just think otherwise you're moving qu then she's going to have three four million Defenders I think she's going to sell Barco for Howard Bellis I think that's what she yeah I think that's probably a better move right than and then you deal with coner a bit later but that is yeah that is um I remember looking at that and thinking that's a disaster and but there will be plenty of people that are in this boat and I think if you're in that boat or you've got a porro if Posta for some reason doesn't give us like firm confirmation then you have to deal with the problems that you have uh GF H says Barco a cell now thought he's going to be a gem yeah didn't we all giddy uh he is I mean he is a sell because he's off he's he's off on loan we think hasn't been confirmed yet but all but all but done it does mean and for anyone wondering about his his price have a look at Neil's article on Scout I mean talk about research that guy some of the stuff he does he's basically looks at all of the most recent players who have had flag Lo last 50 players um and basically come to the conclusion that he will be locked in price essentially yeah so none of them have Dro none of the last 50 players to get loaned out have dropped in price since they were red flagged now we don't know for definite whether the game and canel that I I think he said that no none of them been as highly owned as B at 25 but Canelo was at Sim similarish and he lost like 1.2 million or something and still didn't go down in price yeah and some of those would have been in because we were mid game week when uh when he got got sold um or went out on loan so you would have expected that he would have dropped in price and the fact that he didn't it's quite interesting so I I think there's less panic over Barco but he's still G to have to be dealt with at some point that sounds very Sinister he must be eliminated yeah that's kind of how I feel about him uh not going to lie uh vard I think this is probably quite an easy one sacka to foden you think that's an easy one why I wouldn't do it oh right yeah I agree yeah I thought you were gonna say to do it I wouldn't say sack i' be sacka is a season season hold I think I I can't imagine selling sacker unless something dramatic happens with Arsenal or with him I think Arsenal one of those teams that they're just kind of fixture proof as well like if you've got an Arsenal asset you play them regardless of the fixture yep uh we got five minutes left so let's do a bit of a a quick fire uh Q&A thoughts on Palmer no you want it quick good uh What have you've got him sell him I'd sell him you'd sell him honestly I might give him one more week but honestly he was so wide and I I just don't see the point in that it's a budget if he was eight I'd say hold he's 10 and a half you want 10 and a half player out wide Palmer to foden yes I think is you would be very very tempted to do that this I would do that this just just all over the show how is how is Felix going to slot into that team I've just got absolutely well that's why I've got Inu shaped issues haven't I because what is going to happen with him he's going to have to go up front Inu surely they can't persist with Jackson and have but as he took Inu off rather than Jackson which I was I was just sitting there watching it and I was like are you joking like Jackson's been Dreadful yeah I can't even remember like I just I just don't see how they how they're going to keep Jackson like Netto surely plays on the left and then Palmer in the middle and then it's going to be Felix on the right isn't it surely well I don't know this is the problem they they've got half I mean they've got half the world's footballers in their team apparently 15 of them aren't training with them so okay that makes it all fine then doesn't it if you 15 to train somewhere else I like was like I know it looks like a mess from the outside but inside there's 20 players not training with the first team I like Noe that sounds like a mess from the inside that's a mess if you've got I was saying this to Tom like you was saying oh but it's fine cuz you know 15 of them are training elsewhere and I like Tom that's not fine that's ridiculous that you've got 10 to like 20 players playing somewhere else uh I would sell palmer but if you want to give him another week then fine I just don't like where he's playing fact says mad do you see those pictures Palmer is essential for week three essential he's not essential he's not that's a bit that's a bit far but I mean I can see why people might want to hold him but it's I think it's probably he's a luxury player right now I think he is quite luxury and I think you can can get what he what you get from him from foden and and more enough to worry about you know the team um Abdel says just hate on Chelsea not sure if that's like telling us to hate more we can do that or whether that's you know are we doing to just give it some balance I actually thought Chelsea played all right against Man City yeah so did I I just I thought they played all right I just I just don't see them in FPL being worth it right now and I'm saying that as an Inu owner yeah uh Greg says Ruta 5.5 million out of position uh been doing my research on him talking to some leads fans he looks very exciting but a complete noo as an FP asset he he looks like like a kind of a Dharma tror type loads of energy going to cause defenses loads of problems big strong guy you know might get some assists but he can't score his finishing record is poor and where's he going to play is he going to just completely house Pedro from the from the 10 spot is it going to push Pedro up to we don't know he's a wait and see for me could be a good option at some point but yeah we'll um we we'll have to wait on that one definitely don't buy him immediately uh Adam steo says starting kungu or Smith row I know what Sam will say so as I'm starting Smith row over in canu so that's my answer yeah i' I'd play Smith row I think away I wasn't that impressed with Wolves I thought they gave Arsenal a bit too much respect in that game but I I imagine O'Neal will say to him let's get them you know before they' before the chemistries there well they're still learning these tactics well they don't even know the best 11 let's let's go out and give them a game at home um and we don't even know yeah we don't know anything about about where where uh where Inu is going to play whereas SRO is going to start in the 10 against a a team where Fulham will be expecting to win that so I would I would start him in that one um FP yellow Army says my question is is rashford a 100% cell or should I replace the injured Ana I mean the answer to both of those questions is yes uh but the the key thing is always to replace your weakest yeah one so you have to deal with the injury first Y and thenal with rashford un unless you have how Bellis on the bench because then I think you can just bring him in and and maybe yeah that's true do do something else rashford though like again it's one of those ones you've started with rashford you know his limitations you know he's going to frustrate you was there anything in that game that you saw that made you suddenly think he's got to go where you weren't thinking that surely if you started with rashford youd believe in him to give him a couple of games in the side I'm not saying I'm not saying I would pick him cuz I wouldn't but why would you pick him for one week see him against and be like oh yeah now I've got to sell it because that was that was what rashford's been doing for ages I think I mean maybe it's the Brighton thing that's making because actually Brighton were really good in game week one so possibly it's the like we'll give up CH we'll give up chances though yeah but probably not to rashford and it well it probably will be to rashford because it's veltman on the right and actually rashford against veltman isn't isn't no that's true is terrible no that's true I'd give him I'd give him a I'd give him a week I think you have to replace the injury first and then you deal with the the players that you just don't want anymore afterwards yep uh final question because we've had this a couple of times this is from anti J hi as and Sam hope you're both well oh that's very kind thank you we are yeah we are very well uh what do you guys think about selling Gabrielle and bringing in gavardo nothing in the bank thank you there's actually been a few questions about about that another one from fairs here Gabriel to gardio there was some at the start of the stream as well what what do you think that I can understand why people might be doing that because actually the Arsenal Fixtures are quite hard defensively like obviously it's not just this week against ason Villa but then four it's the London Derby North London Derby and then five it's Man City so I can understand why people are thinking along those lines however the Arsenal defense were brilliant again against wolves like I watched that game and defensively there was a moment where celba I thought was going to mess it up for everybody but apart from that one moment oh yeah I know wol should wol should have scored in that game they should have in that particularly in that moment where I was like celba what are you doing like oh god um but yeah but defensively I genuinely do still believe that Arsenal are the best defense in the league now vardal I think in the next five weeks gets more clean sheets though than the Arsenal defense will but I don't think he's going to add very much if if he continues to play where he did against Chelsea his attacking threat is ma massively lowered this season but he might not when everyone's back in the team and kyl Walker is on that side rather than Rico Lewis it might be that we see him invert rather than Rico Lewis on the other side it's it's a bit of an unknown I personally would feel very uncomfortable more uncomfortable not having a Arsenal Defender than the city one even with the fixtures interesting I'm I'm going to sound like a broken record again and my answer is is going to be similar to what I've said in a couple of these you've started with Gabrielle you haven't started with Gabrielle for one weekly you've started with Gabrielle because you've looked at Arsenal defense and thought this is the best defense in the league and he's going to get some clean sheets I can see why people would want to make the move to gardio and if I'd start with Gabrielle I probably would I I think gardel is a better pick over the next three or four weeks than than Gabrielle but I just wouldn't use a transfer no on it I I just think save the transfer see where we look in two or 3 weeks there might be massive other of improvements you want to make in your team you know it feels like it feels a bit sideways to me and I think unless you think guardio is going to outscore the Arsenal defense by 10 15 points over the next couple then I wouldn't do it and you never know what could happen pictures better but they leak though man City's defense they leak goal arsenals don't so you will and he wasn't he wasn't bombing up and down the wing in game yeah um I can see why you would want to do it and if you really want to do it and you think it's going to be 10 15 points better off I'm not going to tell you not to but I I wouldn't if I'd started with the arsal defender I'd keep him I am 100% in agreement with you yeah well let's let's end on that not that's a lovely way to to end end the stream we had a ghost today I know a ghost all we've had it all going J's been very quiet which has been good I said you before you might bark outside but no he's been he's been very good good as God uh thanks everyone for watching about 600 people watching uh

19,FFScout_,RYEuxvWfAio,JOE&#39;S FPL GW2 TEAM SELECTION! 🔥 | 8 x TOP 10K! 😱 | Fantasy Premier League Tips 2024/25,2024-08-22T07:06:47Z,hello and welcome to another video and podcast from Fantasy Football Scout my name is Joe and today I'm going to reveal my game week 2 draft uh look back on game week one uh I'll also look ahead some of my plans for games weeks three through to 7even um because I think I've got a tiny bit more information this time we've all got a bit more information not a lot of information we got a little bit of information to help us um with our plans in the longer term um before uh we do that um just want to uh plug the members area um any any sort of stats or season ticker and those types of things I mentioned they're all from the uh members area at Fantasy Football SC do check out membership offers there definitely um also be aware that we do have an app this season so you can have all the those stats and data about players and teams Etc all at your fingertips as well um also do press that like button does help us out whether you're uh watching this or listening and do uh do subscribe as well so you update with our latest videos and podcasts as well and do leave a lovely review uh wherever you're listening uh leave a wonderful and complimentary comment on YouTube not interested if it's less than complimentary just a complimentary one please um okay let's have a look to see how I got on in game week one okay so I've got what I've got is I've got my team up on the screen I've got my points and my gameweek rank which is my overall rank currently um so I'm current I got 60 4 Points um I'm which is seven points above the average I think um my gameweek rank so I think there's 8 and a half million players or there certainly was at gameweek one and my game rank is 2.6 million it's utterly meaningless at this stage so if I have a similar week next week it should shoot up quite dramatically um but if I have a poor week then that will plummet quite dramatically so I went into this with a uh 343 um what I'll do with this I'll read out the players I I had I'll read them out again as well because um it's a bit annoying on if you're listening to the podcast version you was think oh what did who did he put on and then I'll sort of go through them in terms of who I'm unhappy with who I'm happy with and who I've had absolutely no control over so I went into this with Henderson porro Quanza and Gabrielle Mina Gordon jotter and Sack I had salanki Harland isach up top I had F fabianski on the bench samon Smith row Barco and Robinson and uh I'll read out that first 11 again Henderson Pedro porro Quanza Gabrielle Mina Gordon Diego jotter uh sacka salanki Harland and isak okay so um uh seven out of my 11 returns in some form um I had two double digit holes and Pedra PA got me nine points so I'm pretty happy with that that's 64 points um that's above average so I'm I'm I'm I'm happy with that um but um so what what I'm happy with in particular uh I I talked about my last video podcast about my game one side I really like the bright and Fulham rotation I talked about how it sort of dub Tails quite nicely and looking at Fulham the way Fulham were way to Manchester United and how I hope they'll be at home the likes of Robinson now Anderson might be joining them um as as we uh as I'm recording this that was the strong rumor that Anderson will be uh moving from Crystal Palace to Fulham so Robinson and Smith row I think will be better options at home or certainly against any easier teams and Brighton I can then bench they they dovetail quite nicely um so I'm happy with that Mina did really well um while he was on the pitch got an assist um barco is a problem um but I'll come to that in a sec um but the principal remains so uh I do have my own another Brighton Defender um because of Barco uh possible Lan move to Seville I hear about today um so I'm happy with that um elsewhere I'm happy I've got Harland because he's playing I switch next week in game week to so great Captain I'm happy that I did U make sure I could get some Arsenal in my team I'm happy with Gabrielle got me a clean sheet such who has a similar role of annoying bloker set pieces for West Ham um got a considerable amount of shots inside the box and so I think Gabrielle could do well against Villa hopefully I'm happy with sacka obviously with his 12 points so very happy with investment in Arsenal I'm very happy with salanki as well he stayed on the pitch longer than all the other attackers for Spurs um uh he's very strong underlying bonus points uh system scores there he had very strong um attacking threat um didn't quite get on the team she uh on the sheet there but I do the goals imminent podcast with Mark each week we do mention sanki there his strong uh promise of returns um so I'm very happy with him there um so that's what I'm happy with what am I unhappy with well it's mainly on the bench so uh I'm not happy with Barco I thought he was going to start uh he done so well in preseason but it turns out that he's going to be loaned out so we wondered why he was benched we thought he may been an injury uh from preseason we thought I I don't know Brighton fans didn't know what to think um but it turns out he saw surplus of requirements there um so we saw hinwood come in for him Brighton so he'll be off but I think his price should be frozen if he goes red flagged because he's out on loan I think his price will come become Frozen um and also I look today I think I think he's very considerably far off uh a price drop so he can just sort of rot until I wild card on the end of my uh bench really I'm not too worried about that quansa is the bigger worry um he started came on 45 minutes um and then was taken off amid uh the Liverpool manager being very very annoyed with the lack of winning of jewels um and of which quer was at fault there so whether his win his place back whether he'll start against brenford at home or win his place I don't know but if you don't know you got a bench really just so I'll have Barco and Quon on my bench now I've got um well I'll talk about my game to too in a minute but um so porro could be an issue if he is injured I haven't heard anything so I'll be looking for pictures of him in training um it looks to be a knock it could be something serious he could be out but I can't risk him being out so I would have to make a move with Barco or k quansa out now I I've still got Quanza he's gone down in price he's 4.4 now not 4.5 so I can't get any 4.5s but I spoke about this on Twitter as well earlier that doesn't bother me his price drop doesn't bother me because I looked at the array of 4.5s the array of 4 million I can't see much of a difference really there's not many there I think Robinson would be the only one I would go for because he's got a great fixture in gameweek 2 but anyone else of the 4.5s they just haven't really got the fixture in gameweek 2 when I really need them um so I think for me if porro definitely out I'll remove him I think I would prefer to get say m Munos very attacking for Palace Gusto at Chelsea I'd prefer to spend a bit more spend a five million on someone who's you know certainly we hope to be nailed but also with more attacking threat so I I on the FPL generals video and podcasts this week um I did a table for him with 4.5 and 4 million options it really wasn't that great um mazra for Manchester United um but theyve got Brighton uh Torres Aston Villa Torres um appeared to be better for the bonus points than um uh than any other Aston Villa um defend of coner in particular um so Torres could be one but once again you know he's got his home to Arsenal so you know I don't really want him there so i' just be getting a using a transfer for a bench player uh bedner sampton W to monitor at 4 million I mean this is how desperate it is I mean I don't want any of these the only one I wanted was Robinson he's already in my team um kilman at West Ham is an interesting one potentially when West Ham improve van heck at Brighton but he's got Manchester United uh the IP switch guys but you know wolf anden and Greaves at 4 million Howard Bellis at sampton 4 million uh possibles um I might have to bring in one of these so if if por is defin if if porro is no actually I'm not going to be one of these thinking it through if porro are definitely out I'll remove porro for a better Defender um quansa and Barco can just rot for a little bit on my bench uh I don't have too much of a problem with that because I'm happy playing Gabrielle I'm happy uh playing Robinson I think for for the fixtures as well going forward I'm actually happy to play Robinson I mean I I would ideally I want to do a Brighton Fulham rotation but fulham's fixtures they got Le Leicester at home game week 2 great I switch away game week 3 fine then they got West Ham and Newcastle at home ideally I want to play a Brighton Defender then so that's when I'll be looking to remove Barco hopefully um but Nottingham Forest away game week six not too bad man city away game s that's when I do not want to be playing Robinson but as we'll see um with my plans I of wild carded by then I think um so that's not too much of a problem but yeah so I'm quite happy to sit sit on my bench really and having the 0.1 drop gone um that's taken out of my hands which is good as well so I can I would prefer to spend a transfer not juggling around 4.5 low ceiling players to focusing on perhaps moving you know premium players or mid-price players so for example Brian buo has sampton at home in gameweek three I think I'd be preferred to use a transfer to get him in um um uh you know rather than these 4.5 Defenders and and I think we can get too consumed by Price people think the price is the be all and end or you got to maintain team value at all costs but you don't have to and and I think I think by the end I think with this season with the players like Salah and Harland and sacka Palmer and you know all these players are are so expensive I think off I've been in a situation where I think I was when I wild carded the second you know the the second part of the Season Wild Card about two or three years ago where the team I wanted I was either like five or six million out or I could get anyone but there was never a point where I thought oh God I'm three out and0 one out I was never really at that point really they were just totally unaffordable or I could get them and I think they'll be same this season as well and also as the season emerges um very low owned low um priced gems will reveal themselves more we already got a potential of a few um in the gos imminence uh uh podcast I've recorded with Mark one name that that um stood out for when West Ham's fixtures improved is Thomas such at 5 million could be a handy little enabler so for example players like that um could could emerge they might not um but I don't I don't think point. one is going to make or break my season whereas moving Quanza to I don't know one of those 4.5s I'm not interested in um or or saving that transfer also when I talk about my transfers in a bit um see the importance of saving a transfer especially if you're going to be moving Harland and Salah around which could happen um okay um so there they're the things that I'm sort of unhappy with uh things I'm happy with and there's two other things that just completely out of my control so we have to accept that this game is to do with there is a bit of luck there is fate in this Newcastle the sending off of share in that game meant that Newcastle didn't really attack sampton attacked but the attack was a bit lame so it was just sampton attack attack attack Newcastle somehow coming away with a result um that could have been very different for me as a Gordon and eak owner I could have been sitting on a ma massive Hall there but I'll never know and that's start out of my control Mina could have been on a massive Hall ding got a goal later on when he placed him uh Mina got an assist looked great in the game he was substituted off with a concussion industry but uh um injury but according to his um uh agent um and the player himself he didn't even have concussion he just got hit in the ribs I think and he was basically okay um but the uh he had a concussion uh substitution um so I I think he'll be back but he'll be um well I'll put my team up in a minute but I I won't be playing him game we too any anyway but um yeah I mean there's a bit of luck there uh bad luck there because that's just out of my control he could have got a huge score he might not have done but he could have got a goal maybe two more I don't know um so anyway so those are the things out of my control so here's my team as it is for game week two um so I've got a once again 343 not dramatic change it's more that bright and Fulham sort of rotation so I've got Henderson in goal Pedro porro Gabrielle Robinson Smith row Gordon Diogo jotter sacka and up front salanki Harland who is my captain because he's home to whip switch and isaach who I've got my Vice Captain at the moment way to Bournemouth but could easily be sacka or jotter or salanki I've got lots of sort of good backup options there Vice Captain on my bench got fabianski Mina so Smith R comes in for mina K Quanza who is back back to the bench Barco he's so far along my bench he's practically in Seville I'll read out those that my first 11 again just for the benefit of those listening on the podcast Henderson Pedro porro Gabrielle Robinson Smith row Gordon J jotter um sacka salanki Harland and isaach um okay yeah so yeah I mean there's not really much to say with this I would like to preserve the transfer if I can I'm I'm more than happy with this team um uh to go into it if there's any of my tackers are out I've got Mina to come in it's the defense that's a problem and it's porro so the worst thing for me would be porro not training the manager saying I hope we will have to assess him tomorrow that just too much doubt there that may force me into doing something like quansa or Barco to um uh Sal a sampton Defender because they play n and Forest this week so I'd be happy for them as my sort of bench backup um and also it solves one of the problems of quono and Barco so I would do that move but I don't really want to do that so fingers crossed for porro the rest of them I'm fairly safe are going to play um so for example I don't know if there's an injury to Smith row or Minter will come in I'm I'm happy with that I'm I'm I'm you know it's Manchester United but Bin's be at home um I you know he not he's not concussed so um so the concussion protocol you know he's being monitored but being monit it's like I don't know you know he's uh he he'll be absolutely fine I'm sure of it um okay so um that's my team for game we two and I said the only issue is I is I is I don't want to make a Defender transfer but I may have to if pod if Pedro PA is definitely out then as I said I'll look I'll look back at my at 5 million options 5.5 options maybe but I I like the Lu to Munos perhaps be happy to play him week in week out very attacking uh Gusto Chelsea very attacking Chelsea have very strong fixtures um and speaking of the fixtures I'm going to put uh the fixtures up now so what I've got up on screen um is a slightly modificate mod modified uh version of the fixture so it's from game weeks 2 to7 um from the Fantasy Football Scout members area it's sorted uh by uh difficulty um and also I put other top above the fixtures of what possible moves I might make something I did last season when I did the team Reveal video with Tom um I sort of had a a sort of a vague plan um that I just put put into my phone and notes of what I wanted to do potentially with transfers so um for game weeks two and three um I want I will use only one transfer because I want to either save a transfer this week or save a transfer next week because I want to go into game weeks four with two transfers um if I end up saving two transfers in game weeks 2 and three I would go into game week four with three transfers but I don't know if I necessarily need that and I also think it might be quite good to take advantage of a of of a shift so for example porro is not ideally in game week three so I might have to make that defensive um uh switch anyway which might prompt me to make that move um so for example sampton away to brenford in game week 3 is not ideal but they've got at least they've got two sort of okay fixtures so I you know that that that that move could be made there as I said it's not ideal though what I've written up in here is one move I'd quite like to make in game week three is possibly to remove jotter um because I'm got my eye on getting Salah instead and I'm I I don't know going forward whether jotter is um totally nailed on in that number nine role he does have a bad H injury record as well um but anyway he's got brenford at home game we two happy to play him then then away to Manchester United I don't know whether that's going to be a jotter game and I could make a switch there to a couple of better players I think um longer term well next few fixtures at least I could make a switch to Bailey for Aston Villa got away to Leicester then he's got Everton wolves and ipswitch so um that could be quite profitable I could play Bailey throughout there um I could also make a move perhaps to um uh looking at that and Brian bomo yeah so um he has got Bren he's got sampton at home so the he's bottom of the Season ticker brenford but at the moment but but the sampton game will put him top top for that week probably so I think Brian BMA could be quite good I'm quite happy to play him through tougher fixtures then he's sort of in place I think his team is value is going to go up um so I want to make sure I can afford him although as I said I don't know whether price changes uh will make two tremendous amount of difference so say Brian Burma goes up to um I don't know 7.5 or something I'll probably either better afford him or not afford him whether he was seven or 7.5 but but I think think there would be a better use of a transfer but as I said I might be forced into one and you know I'll happy to do that cheap Defender one um so it's game weeks four and we can see with the fixture ticker there's a change there so man city have brenford at home it's okay but I don't know I don't feel confident enough I think I prefer to Captain um uh game in gameweek four don't know I mean looking at that I think I'd prefer to Captain Salah at home to ningan Forest so I might make either in game week four or gameweek five um a move from Salah to Harland um and I'll we do that with two transfers you need that obviously Sal Salah is a midfielder um and the reason is because Liverpool they've got Nan forest and Bournemouth at home game weeks four and five then they've got Wolves Away in game week six um which is very strong so very strong sort of three um set of three fixtures there meanwhile Manchester City they've got that brenford home game uh but then they got Arsenal at home don't fancy that for the captaincy Newcastle away don't fancy that for a Highland captaincy either then they have fullum at home in game week seven and that Heralds a very very strong run um for uh Manchester City so yeah they got fulam and then they got wool sampton Bournemouth and Brighton after that um so I'd want Harland back so my rough plan is use only one transfer in games weeks two or three gameweek four or five possibly gameweek four used two transfers to switch Harland to Watkins remember I spoke about Aston Villa's fixtures improving and Gordon who I don't think I'll need to Salah and i' got currently a million in the bank to do that move if I make any of the other moves say joted down too that's another 0.5 I've got in the bank or Defender switch a quaner to to 4 million um could be could be a move I I make so there's definitely money to be made there and I I think I can afford that move and I like that move and I think I prefer Salah to Harland now a lot of people you know side strongly with Salah but this fixture here is the Harland one at home to whip switch and that's the one that's going to be sort of make or break for Harland so if he doesn't do so well then then I'm going to be slightly more annoyed with him but you know he looks good you know he said he looks good he's in the best best form he's actually had a preseason um so in game week seven I'm going to want Harland back and I can do I can live without Salah um so uh he's got Crystal Palace away in game week seven they slip down the fixture ticker because they got Chelsea Arsenal Brighton and Aston Villa up next so there's potential there but I do prefer man City's fixtures uh after that so gameweek seven in order to get harand back if I can't do that in another two moves uh I would wild card and I think that's the perfect time to do it so for me um it was something I spoke about on uh Tom Freeman's um Team Reveal video and he makes an interesting point if you've got lot if you haven't got a lot of Arsenal um then gameweek six is the time you'd want to wild card cuz they G for game from game week six Arsenal face Leicester and then Sal it's a good run um but before that they've got Tottenham and Man City so you can live without Arsenal now I've got sacka and Gabrielle I have no intention of getting rid of either of them so my motivation to Wild Card in game week six is much less um especially if I've already got some Aston Villa in my team and I've already got Salah um but it's gameweek seven my motivation to Wild Card really escalates because I'm less keen on Salah I'm more keen on Harland harland's 15 million um so um I can't see myself not having uh Harland in then unless he's say injured for example we're getting strong Vibes he's going to be rotated um so I think P I've got a tentative Wild Card pencil in for game week seven from my team game week six I you what you'll hear is a lot of stuff on Twitter and content creators saying oh if you're not wild card in game week 4 gaming six is the best one ah then we're back in the familiar territory of best for you content Mr content creator but not best for you Mr viewer um and so I think you need to look at your own team and one of the key things to look at in game week six is if you're really short of Arsenal and um then then that could be a good time to wild card but bear in mind Harland is a way to Newcastle then and you might want to be getting Harland de you might want to be ignoring him but if you're like me and you're okay with Arsenal you got Salah this is me in the future and you want to get Harlem back in game week seven might be better or maybe even later but game week seven I think for my team looks the sort of best time but anyway it's good to get these thoughts together because you can do this yourself go on go on to Fantasy Football Scout members area sort the season ticker by difficulty do your own notes at the top and just to see what you're going to do because as I've talked about before it's like man managing your team in FB it's like a wave you're riding this 38 game week wave and you're going up and down you you got to try and navigate it and select the right uh uh strategies for that and so I think uh for me personally at the moment be slightly patient with transfers but not afraid to use them and above all try and get those two transfers for game week four or five hopefully for four to do that harand Salah switch hope that's been a help um it certainly helped me to sort of get my thoughts together um good luck with the game week uh do remember to press that like button do remember to subscribe um and I won't be around next week so I won't be revealing my gameweek three um team but I'll be back uh gameweek four will be the next one there so good luck with that um let's hope we'll rise up in the rankings um see you soon,4840
20,AboveAverageFPL,NoiJHbJhm1U,FPL GW2 Triple Captain Chip Active | Fantasy Premier League 24/25,2024-08-21T22:09:03Z,game week one is locked up hopefully you guys were all above average game week two is coming we've had price drops we've had players leaving let's have a look at our gameweek two [Music] teams right guys welcome back this is the above average FPL podcast my name's Adam and as always I'm joined by Baker evening mate how are you I'm not too bad not too bad I'm on the it's my turn for on the road today so uh I'm at the in-laws for the week uh I've got that standard thing of the second you take a week off you immediately get a cold um what why does it do that why do why does it body just go stuff that I'm getting a cold straight away um so I'm fting that off but yeah at the in-laws hence surroundings borrowing their computer and uh yeah one week in the bank one week in the bank definitely definitely and so what we do on a Thursday for anyone or doesn't know uh we're recording on Wednesday night just so everyone's aware um is we basically go through our team selection for the next game week I think for the early part of this season there's going to be a lot of uh you know being comfortable with the picks that we've already made and just basically trying to negotiate what uh what sort of rotation we're going to do maybe and it's I guess focus on captaincy picks but we'll go through uh a couple of Graphics fixture tickers uh and some expected data for the week and then we'll run for our teams and then we will get out of here and let you get on with your day so are you feeling good after game week one mate uh I feel like we've got through game week one so um I think I think I finished 65 points something like that you know a disappointment at the end for us being Spurs fans with Monday night that was not it was fine for 60 odd minutes it was lovely it was we watched some lovely football I was like oh this is second season Ang I could really feel it but sank just wasn't able to put the ball in the net um some interesting stuff that definitely looked like he was really trying hard to hit the target and we've talked about the fact that often didn't hit the target last season so um let's see how all of it let's see how it rolls out after a couple of weeks like I don't think we should make huge changes unless we have to but hey there's a lot of people already that now have to you know K Quanza we've seen that first thing haven't we where someone relatively well owned is suddenly dropping in price and people have a decision to make and what's been really interesting is in previous Seasons everyone just made it and now there's a carrot that says if you can hold transfers you'll get more reward from doing it it's changed absolutely nothing everyone just did it yeah yeah this is true yeah that's true true loads of people did it I know that um I think Andy made a move I think Holly made a move um yeah I think I think I would have done the same thing and I know a few people there were people asking our Discord last night like like should I make this move and I was thinking well the way I would play it is yes is probably I would because cool fine you're going to be a transfer behind you still have the opportunity to get you know build those transfers up earlier on in the season you've got just more time to build those transfers back up again and you've dealt with the problem you've dealt with the problem who's clearly a clearly going to be a minutes risk because slot's not going to sit around and go oh everything's fine I will keep these players on um he he's going to make a decision when things aren't quite going right so and you have to either be like really resilient because if you pick if you pick up let's just say this weekend if you have Quanza there's people out there that got Quanza and they two bench Defenders are Konza and Barco yeah well barco is now on event and kza you don't want to play because he's got a yeah but I do think there's a little bit of why did you put conu on my team I put K on my team because he's good from game week three onwards and I'm like well why you now making a move this week because you're actually creating trouble for yourself like I do think there is a part where if I'd picked a Defender like for example a conza for gameweek three gameweek four I don't think I would have made the Quant move yeah cuz we don't know we don't know enough like I mean but what I'm saying is the second there's a price drop it's such a big decision because if he goes to 4.4 what do you do yeah yeah yeah I mean and obviously Pedro's Pedro po has not helped that because as it stands we we don't know what the situation is like it's very interesting that perro is sort of he's active on social media he's tweeting he's insing do you know what I mean he's replying as Spurs that stuff and you're like does that mean he's okay like I like to think that means he's okay but we don't know he's okay I think he'll be fine I mean I think I think he'll be fine hopefully anyway Spurs assets just just because we didn't cover it this weekend uh what would you do if you had son I think this week I'd hold son I mean look at look at Everton's right back situation like it's Ashley Young get sent off and they've got who Mason hallgate or something like that playing right back it's it's it's still an opport it's still a good fix you for son he's still a great player look he had a couple of bad touches but still he could have he still could have had um he could have had assists on Monday definitely and yeah cool he only had one you only had one shot and you know you tweeted out that Bloody video of him uh like the worst touch you've ever seen but he's still Sun he's still Sun at the end of the day and you know we've seen already we're going to create chances we we could have blown Leicester away in the first half but we just didn't create enough High quality chances to make that happen um maybe maybe a couple so I think son's perfectly fine for this week and there's there's an easy exit route right there's an easy exit route on sun in game week three you've got sacka sitting there um with with a nice little home game or if you can find a couple of million you know if you if you're sitting on Harland and Sun for example then you know you've got youve got an easy move that you could drop harand down to Watkins and then you can move sun to Salah right there's there's definitely exit points um you know if you don't have Trent for example if you've got Quanza for example when you want to get up to Trent you know there's there's definitely ways to get out of sun but game week two against Everton is not one for me it's not we have got to be quite Precious on transfers is I have started to think about you know a bit more about these Wild Card windows and stuff and I think if you're using transfers I I really wouldn't want to be using transfers and be looking to play Wild Card in game week four yeah so I think the second you use because if you use your transfers now and then you wild card and then what happens is there's people that you're then fighting that have transfers in the bank and a wild card you can't fight them because they're going to then Wild Card ahead of you so they're ahead of you in the game but they've also got more transfers in the bank it's it's a really dodgy situation I actually think a little bit if you think that you're really itching to make transfers because you made a lot of mistakes start thinking about walking away from the game for two weeks just pick your captain hope for the best for two weeks and then wild C in going week four and get it done and then at least have transfers in the bank to fight the people that do it after you're not going to be too far behind I don't think because because those that have picked uh those that have picked Salah at the start right generally speaking have had a really good week this week so you're not you're already ahead if you picked har and you've got this week coming up if you pick both then obviously you've got the best of both worlds but you know you will have had a good start in some in some way right yeah uh so I don't think there's any like like you say there's no there's no rush to do that I think praying patience is probably a good plan and I think you know one of the easiest ways I think to to try and get yourself to hold is go to your mini leagues you're playing in go to your mini leagues and look at the people that are around you in your mini leagues or even just around you in the overall rank right and look at some of those teams they're not perfect teams like we get so Twitchy the second our team doesn't look perfect but there's plenty of teams around you that have done really really well they probably aren't working quite as hard as you are on this do you know what I mean because because Something's Happened that's given them some points or they've done they've locked into something or other like those things do happen at this time of the season and therefore your team's not terrible we think it's terrible because we see so many teams on Twitter and always match ourselves up against it well that person's got that and I haven't got that so I must have this and do all this stuff but realistically most teams around 65 points for example this week a lot of them have just got some good players some not some good players some okay stuff some not okay stuff you know there's loads of people around me that have got Watkins for example I bet they're not selling Watkins this week well there there are some selling Watkins this week actually inter but you'd be well disappointed you just literally looked at one of my many leagues and same points as me as a person that started conza has odard obviously that didn't return has Palmer that was playing a lot wider than we expected the blank has a front three of Watkins J Pedro a minis but why has he got the same points as me because he c s yeah yeah Sal that that's literally all you need to do so like maybe even if your team's not perfect this week but you you get on the right end of Salah versus Holland this week maybe that's enough maybe that's enough yeah now you just made me look as well and I'm I'm level with a guy who's got Romero foden Luis Diaz mateta see do you know what I mean it's still so volatile it's still so vol and a captain can play a really big deal like we can chill out a bit I think I agree I agree so let's have a look at the let's have a look at the fixtures for um we'll go straight to Rob T for the ticker for game week two and so we're looking at basically the expected goals based on the spreadex data um I'm looking extremely red at the moment so I apologize for that but I will I will we will sort that out next time um big standouts here are good teams have uh good chances of scoring high amounts of goals I think he's pretty much what what we see here City 3.3 expected goals I doubt you'll see many higher than that all season um with a 55% chance of a clean Spurs 2.35 36% chance of a clean uh Liverpool 2.95 with a 40% chance of a clean other notable ones being Fulham um at home to Leicester with a 34% chance of a clean which is you know it's interesting really interesting and then Arsenal 32% I mean I won't talk about Chelsea because that no one's got any Defenders from Chelsea really uh so yeah all all kind of interesting here obviously City being being the big fixture I mean just just one thing I would say is Arsenal 32% chance of a clean w v is higher than I would have expected it to have been i' expected that to have been like 20% or so um but it's it's pretty big it's pretty big um for you know I think a lot of people were looking at you know benching Arsenal Defenders this week um and I still get it because if you've got a Fulham City a Tottenham or a Liverpool Defender it makes sense yeah but I'm not sure it makes a huge amount of sense for many other Defenders that that you could have um this week um I'm not sure there's really the upside probably Munos is probably the only other guy that I think would be a question mark on whether you would bench an Arsenal Defender for them um P with a 28% chance of a clean at home to West Ham with a threat of attacking returns you know he's one where it' be a really tight decision for me but I think other than that um you know I've got I've got Lewis Hall and I've got Gabrielle for example and Newcastle at Bournemouth You' think would be a better fixture than Arsenal or Villa it's not how the bookie see it and it's kind of not how I see it Lou Hall firmly sitting on my bench um I think my other big takeway on this was that I think this is really been built up as this is the week that har and kappers win 2.95 expected goals for Liverpool is literally one of the top 10 of the Season yeah I still think so I still think so on that point though I still think there's uh there's more opportunity for returns to be split around the Liverpool attack didn't I not say that last week I think I said that last week there's more opportunity for it to be split around the Liverpool attack versus versus the city attack I think I mean I know obviously kovic scores last week um I I mean I'd I'd probably argue that Chelsea are a better side than IP switch especially at home versus it switch away but um I don't think there's going to be too much debate on that but you know we'll we'll see as you know as we saw from the first half hour of it switch last week I mean I don't even know how they're going to set up I mean there was even an article um I think John McKenzie did some work on how Chelsea set up against City this week right and they set up in this 424 that caused them issues created um created them problems and how did I switch set up against uh against Liverpool 424 so you know maybe the players are you know of a of a of a lower quality I mean I feel harsh saying that about it Swit players but you know they are you know they were pretty effective manity City yeah as much as people say oh you're going to surprise a few people like it's ch it's Premier League champions versus promoted side like at home yeah so yeah oh let's not dumb down the fct of Holland but I think you know in my head head when you're like doing the Highland or Salah selection it's like Holland's going to get a 20 point of this week and Mo's going to get a two yeah yeah yeah it could easily be the other way around it could be yeah it could be it could be it can be any given week can't it but you know when when both teams are expected free the likelihood is both Walk Away about 10 points yeah expected will be some expected points for these games for both these players will be about eight points yeah I think harand was slightly higher in review preseason I think he was on about 9.7 yeah but it's yes it's like 9.7 versus eight so it's it's not it's not far they're good games so when you hear you know people that have just got Salah go oh I'm so scared are you they're not scared no they they they've played that out in our head because because I when started telling you then that that Salah was going to do okay I could see it in your head you were like that's not how it's played out in my head not in my head that's not how that's not that's not how I want it no it's definitely not how how do you how do you want it to be oh I want I want like a Harland hattrick please and I want Salah to get booked and miss a penalty it's exactly what I want that's exactly what I want um yeah so yeah cuz you know I don't think I've hidden it from anyone that I've firmly got the triple Captain chip on harland's armband at the moment and you know again I can't I can't find a way for someone to convince me that it's not the best idea best chance of minutes home fixture promoted side just just no replacement as well that's that's one of the other bits that's changed since the start of the Season obviously is that is that Bob and Alvarez were the two natural people to take minutes from Harland yeah neither neither remember there so it is it is as far as I know i' saw people were saying about you know maybe home to Southampton is slightly better than home to ipswitch or home to Leicester might be this is now you you get it now you've got the most guarantee of minutes you know he's going to be there you know what he's going to play yeah maybe they maybe they are better fixtures but maybe he's injured or maybe he's tired or maybe it's maybe it's the week before they play by leverkus in the Champions League like yeah like this is this is the thing as you say it's it's now it's in front of us let's go basically yeah I don't I don't think you there's no way I would talk anybody out doing it I completely see it I won't be doing it um but that's not to say that I won't be cheering on every second of every goal that's there um it's just I I'll quite happily wait I think there'll be opportunities um I'm really comfortable in that um I do actually think that if I had both Harland and mo I think I would Captain Mo this week if I had both interesting well because you covered realistically he's going to be 150% owned or something like that this week Holland you've covered two-thirds of it in the best possible you can if you get lucky against the triple cappers and Mo goes off and you've capped him him like it's such a monster win yeah yeah yeah no I don't disagree with that but when you own both like they've both got great fixtures especially because sack's got most people are covering the that have got Harland are trying to cover um you know people like you that are trying to cover it with the sum of the parts yeah and that includes Bruno in there um for example you know or it's sacka well Bruno hasn't got a brilliant fixture this week yeah and sacka hasn't got a brilliant fixture it's okay but it wouldn't surprise you if Villa turned up and won that game it's not a brilliant fixture um so Mo's got like a definite Edge over over them anyway so if you offered me double Mo and Harland versus double Harland and sacka I'd take the double Mo yeah fair enough like if you've gone big and gone you know what I'm going to put it all in on those those two I'd be really really tempted to to to go with Mo as well and just if it if it works you've already had a really great first week you've absolutely hammered it in two weeks and if it doesn't I I think you're going to give a lot back to the crowd no and then you're going to be ready you're going to be ready when everyone sort of flocks over to Mo for game week four right and then you're going to start getting these price Rises you're going to start yeah getting them in because I think we're going to have to start moving early in the international break to get him in yeah we're all gonna be big on this but but Mo's gonna be Mo's going to be about 80 90% owned because everybody that's just got MO is going to cap Mo cap him yeah exactly so you're actually not capping Mo you're not getting a lot out of that either yeah so if I if I have both I genuinely think I would I would C up this week I think it's just a good opportunity but each to their own with it I suspect the reason that a lot of people got both Harland and Satler is that they wanted this they they wanted the cap on on Harland this week yeah but I just think I just think there's an opportunity there potentially presented themselves and it could present itself again in gameweek four as well when they' both got decent games yeah yeah so quite a lot of people you've got you say you got triple Newcastle you're obviously benching Hall still think it's a fine fixture for Gordon and esack because that's one that's that's one that I'm not sure about is like I can see obviously like Newcastle here almost 1.9 um expected for the week but if you're going to play into this homeway narrative that Gordon seems to want to try and continue to fuel then is this a fixture where Maybe you could uh you could let him go for a week as I mean like rotate him out if you've got players like full and players cuz some of us have got one some of us have got one full and player some of quite a few people will have two just because they're cheap and the fixtures are good and they've obviously got like the game week two gameweek three um and then and then run from there so are you're asking if I had Smith row would I bring him off the bench for Gordon yeah and I know the minutes obviously last week weren't great but yeah still the opportunities there I don't I don't think I would okay I don't think I would I don't think I would I just back you know what Gordon's been for the last this year um about the player back some kind of um response albe it there's no share but you know is is they need to get the season going I think Bournemouth will give him a really good fight which means that I think the new car will have to do a really good fight to get something out of this game um yeah I would be not be surprised if it's 2-0 a two sorry um type game sort of The Bookies have it leaning that way um Fulham I still think it's the same situation that there's many players that can return yeah they that they don't score a huge number of goals and if they only scored to who are the players that are going to score it I've seen a lot of people looking at maybe Smith Row in this week if there was anything in the next couple of days that had good affirmation about Andreas Pereira I think I'd go there he he the more I looked into his numbers he played played 89 minutes that's more than Smith row yeah he took he took all eight Corners they had in the game he's on penalties and he made six chances the most in the league this week last he made the most chances in the league in game we won like if you think that you want to say for example you've got a bit nerv and kungu and you and you think you're going to Wild Card early maybe andas is but there's still lots of rumors in there about maybe sty links and will he go somewhere and do all out space but he's more likely to stay fit and if he's on the pitch he's got the pens yeah I mean smithr does have a sense of like shiny new toy thing going on that I think that are people are seeing this and I guess obviously trying to hope that he rekindles some kind of form that he saw saw at Arsenal um I think i' feel more confident in just chuck if so say my double up was like Muniz and Robinson I feel like Robinson's just like a Sho in I think you just have to get him in I think if Anderson comes in as well and you know he he makes things better at the back you know he's just automatic um I think if you're sitting with Smith Smith Row versus Muniz like if you've got one or the other munis feels a lot easier to bring in for say um wow actually depends I guess if you're on Salah I guess if you're on Salah then maybe you don't have Harland and you've got isack Muniz and salanki no even that doesn't really work like like you won't you wouldn't play over over esack would you no no it doesn't make any sense no if you had two budgets if you had mun and Pedro yeah then you'd play mun play minutes yeah yeah I think that's that's fine that's that's where my mind was going and then the more I thought about it that second Striker that third Striker is going to be yeah if if you had Smith row and a Chris Wood this week which one would you play I mean that's I'd probably play I'd probably play uh I probably play Chris Wood to be honest no I think I would play SMI over but like it is is weird is it like n not notest 1.38 expected goals but would you be surprised if 0.7 of them is one shot from chriswood no exactly um exactly yeah I mean the narrative is he's played terrible on the weekend um and I spoke to Matt it does host the forest Focus part and he felt he felt we had he felt we did a good good job he was at the forest Bournemouth gabes we did a good job of uh Rec calling that one which I was quite pleased about because we often get told we don't really you know favor the teams outside the big six yeah um but he said he sort of agreed is you know wood was pretty terrible by the one shot he had um he was a big fan of seeno um liked him a lot um yeah it's difficult would I would play Chris Wood or I mean I don't want to draw I don't want to draw comparisons but last I mean we're going to talk maybe about bumo in a minute maybe not for this fixture maybe for next week but um like bumo terrible for long periods and then scores Harland very often terrible for long periods 15 million we all have him like I it's just it's just because he's a big kiwi and he's not like a he's not like a Norwegian meat shield with long blond air that we just go oh well are you saying that if Chris Wood was at city it's got 50 goals a season of course he would because like no he's not going to score 50 goals a season but he will score he would score double the amount of score goals he scores at Forest any Striker would any Striker at that level would I mean you just score more goals because you're at City you just would you would um you haven't gotten kungu I do not uh obviously there's now J Felix potentially coming in or whatever and it gets even more ridiculous um we've got now lots of players that he's now just saying nah I'm done with you I think the sassy is now decided he's done as well yeah um I don't want to touch Chelsea I I I hate the fact that their fixtures are so good but I just don't want to touch them yeah I'm really un comfortable with it I think that's the right approach but you haven't touched Chelsea but I have and many have with kungu I think you have to let this game play out yeah you have to assume that they won't play free Central midfielders again you know don't play Enzo kaiso and Lavia yeah um which brings the opportunity for a 10 which could be in kunu um you'd Hope was in kungu and if he doesn't play you make a move on Saturday yeah but do it with two transfers rather than do it one yeah yeah do it with two transfers don't do it one that's my that's my Fe on this one is is um because not many people have got money sitting around and a week makes a big difference you're also you're also it's also people are going to be moving you know some some people that may have held on to a Quanza like you're going to be moving money you're going to be moving 11 million round in two transfers that's that's a little bit easier than trying to sort of navigate from a four five 44 down and try to figure out what you need to do and try and really scrape the barrel as you say another week of information we might have a four another 40 that comes out maybe the one thing I would say is everyone's going to say like like I've just said they're lit don't do them you have it's almost like you got a position this moment I'm a guy that doesn't have Salah I have Harland I think Harland teams you should not be moving out on kungu if you've got a Salah team and a Salah team only and you've already got Trent so you're not going to be looking to bring in Salah or Trent in game week four you're a transfer up at least on me on what I'm looking to do so you might decide in that situation yeah it's okay so someone does make that move like look at your team work out who am I going to do in 2 three 4 at the moment because I went Gabrielle over Trenton I need it I need free transfers really in the bank to get salar in my team and get Tren in my team because probably the best way to afford it or the only way to really afford that kind of thing is to sell Highland yeah so I can't do it till game week four and I want to do three now if I make a move this week I immediately can't do the triple without taking a minus four yeah so I'm immediately pushing myself slightly further towards wild card yeah whereas I'd like to maybe go one more week have two in the bank and then make a decision of actually how am I going to do this move what's it going to be get an extra week for it where's my Wild Card going to be just doesn't make sense to do it right now agreed uh any other teams you want to touch on while we're here I think we pretty cover covered all the big ones so let's get on to teams let's have a look at your team first so this is your team very familiar team very familiar team so yeah it'll be Henderson and gold again which is now getting weaker um orbe it you know link to a center back move today but Anderson won't be there this weekend it's not helpful and I think he goes straight into that FM team don't you like he's been there before he knows it it's happened earlier enough in the week straight same he's got well yeah when you got Calvin Bassie it's quite a quite a nice easy switch I heard a thing saying that they think he'll play alongside Calvin mie maybe can tame him maybe you can t a little bit Yeah there's quite a lot of people that think you kin bass is quite the talent I think there's a lot of FPL guys that think as much um so porro um Anthony Robinson will come in for Hall I've got a whole first bench if I had to play him over parro because parro's out I wouldn't be gutted it's not the worst thing in the world um so that's okay yeah and then I've got Gordon sacka and kungu and jotter in the Midfield salanki isack har cap singular cap well nice you know we always call that we always got singular cap but technically it's double cap isn't it you can't because it's got to be double cap to be then go Triple cap yes so I'm double capping you're double capping and then your bench you got sangari and Johnson and whatever yeah good no drama no drama okay well run run to mine then nice and quick and easy um so yeah at the moment I'm still sticking with the double Arsenal defense so I've got Rya and Gabrielle uh playing Trent and porro and bringing in Anthony Robinson um midfielder Gordon JTA Bruno and uh and Smith row and then and Harland and salanki up top Triple cap on Harland means I've got a bench that includes Gibbs white and JIA Pedro means that I can I'm I'm quite not happy but I can comfortably move out porro if I need to to to either one of them yeah um outside of that I'm pretty comfortable with how how how that's set up the only obviously decisions is whether I start with a double Arsenal defense you know I understand that the percentage chance of a clean sheet has dropped obviously versus last week but at the same time you know there's there's there's a world where Arsenal just keep them out to like 0.25 XG and it's just an absolute nonsense game where they just basically stifle it completely uh go to their you know I I I no doubt that arteta is going to go to these away games in against the teams from the top six last year and go look just killed a game just don't let him have anything and we'll get a point and run away and if that's the way they play and they get a goal then that's better for them obviously worse for us but uh you know so double Arsenal defense I still feel pretty comfortable about it uh obviously I'm benching two penalty takers which feels really really nerve-wracking uh yeah I don't like it which isn't which doesn't sound like a load of fun but uh and the biggest thing obviously gives why is that he was brought in for the good first three fixtures as well so I kind of just moved it for because Fulham were okay against United I mean they did concede quite a few big chances to them obviously to Bruno primarily so yeah are Forest going to get those big chances are you know um sorry are leester gonna get those big chances maybe it's just it's just pens the one thing I would say is obviously I thought Madison had a really good game um against Leicester you know obviously knows that ground very very well but the 10 had a lot of freedom and that could easily be the same on gives why I would I would ask in this one because I know you're long enough here that I know that if you had Gabrielle on your bench and they cleaned you would be fuming and I know that's how you are because you even when you talk about it you only talk about the two as double defense if you don't I've got Ryan G you you make them they're two or nothing they yeah they're all they're all as one they come as a pair because that's they come as a pair because because that's that's how you separate that yeah but then separ yeah but then you're then but then you're hedging right and you know I hate hedging and that's how you know it's not necessarily hedging it's going what my best 11 players for this week you can't do anything about the keeper is yours and I'd ask yourself if that Ry was Henderson in goal just picture it in your mind if it was Henderson would you change your mind on Gabrielle and is it that Rya because you got to play ryer is swaying you to think got I think I'd be more likely to play Gabrielle actually well because you'd be worried that you didn't have a part of that defense an Arsenal Defender yeah I I think I think an Arsenal Defender is almost like you need to have one every week but therefore you don't lose anyway because you got R um and whereas you whereas you gain XEL Pedro and Gibbs white have got like no ownership really like whatever they do you smash it like like they your bigger game type options but I would try and all I would say is mar it would be like tackle him into isolation and work through just do I like Gabrielle more than gives white and J Pedro because you can't swap Ry for him but you can swap Gabrielle for them they don't have to be a double act because otherwise you're stuck with this forever you're literally going to be every of I got to play him I've got to play him we got to play him and in two weeks time it's north London Derby mate so two two weeks time in two weeks time we'll find a way to get Gabriel out it's fine um but yeah it does it does feel difficult to me that you are benching two penalty takers that makes me feel really scared um but hey we've already talked about it V conceded what was it 18 set piece goals last season yeah something like that that's the 50 % chance they ConEd a set piece goal this week and you've got Gabrielle who we didn't catch that had a shot but from a set piece but actually did uh had a header so yeah there's always that there's always that opportunity as well yeah there is Gibs white jaia Pedro I'm not so worried about I don't feel like only the only the only problem with Brighton is they just got lots of dribbly Wingers and United have lots of slow Defenders even he comes in yeah we don't we don't know the impact of what georgino will do at Brighton but we do know that he's like a striker that wants to play 10 and and he just is a 10 really that's why he's been that's why he's down as a midfielder that's why he's down as a 5.5 midfielder because he likes to play along the line similar to like a like an Alvarez way in the you know it's why he gets more assists than goals is because he's an all round player works really really hard he kind of Suits what Herz would want for a 10 I wouldn't be surprised if Welbeck stays as the nine as Pedro stays as the 10 georgino comes on at 10 and Pedro goes up top for the last 20 minutes so I think everyone said that this is a this is a this is bad for Pedro minutes it might actually be good for Pedro minutes because you might get 70 minutes of 10 and 20 minutes of nine as opposed to at the moment 80 odd minutes of 10 um you know he came off last game for sento sento is not a 10 he's he's a left-sided player well he's a utility player he can play left back left wing right back right wing but he's majority a flank player um which you know I think georgino has come in to sort of replace gross and and I think Ferguson wasn't on the bench last week so I think I think Pedro I don't think I don't think we immediately see Pedro go nine I I think a lot of people have got got 10 and Pedro play nine all the time I don't think that either um I don't think you suited to play 90 minutes of nine every week but I do think he's quite well suited a bit like bumo used to where it'll be 70 minutes in the hole last 20 minutes he's up top and we know how many points bu used to get playing those last 20 minutes on top up top like Pedro playing nine for the last 20 minutes if he hasn't got a penalty can you imagine it it'll just be baning contact Left Right Center doing anything you can to get it um ah yeah no okay fair enough something to think about but would you would you prefer jaia Pedro or would you prefer Gibbs white then because if it's can one they both both had one shot last week so it's not like it that either of them have got like an overwhelming case but they're both good picks too you're in a really enviable position mate everyone else you got people sitting I'm gonna bench points I'm GNA bench point and kungu and all this stuff you ain't got any of them you got bench headaches yeah so yeah I'm gonna Ben I'm gonna bench some points uh but do I so do I make sure do do I just sacrifice the the poten poal Sixpoint Arsenal for the I mean where's I feel like the upside is still with Gabrielle like I feel like the upside is still gab with Gabrielle I feel like the floor is higher just just is higher I want to see maybe I want to watch that Villa game back again and just see how threatening they were because they were obviously just they were obviously playing West Ham a little bit different I guess its first game at home as well for the season H yeah it's tough mate yeah it's tough but that's where we are that where we are so no transfers no transfers no no we're definitely I mean there's almost no way you're making a transfer and it's no no no very unlikely that I do yeah no I think think happy enough where where we are at the moment we can let it roll you know 60 odd points 65 for you say 61 for me so you know it's good start um harland's come this week so yeah know I think think it's pretty straightforward we got to pray mate we got to pray because if we don't win this week if if we're Harland and we don't win this week panic I don't think it's panic but I think you can just you can just you can just move on you can just move on because it's It's Gonna Get tetty Well transfers transfers will be made probably but then but you have is you can make you can make a transfer next week because because moving Harland to Watkins enables your double Liverpool in the future like you're saying the Inu move this week doesn't allow you to do that but next week you can make that move and even if you have six million in the bank right like it sounds like a terrible thing but yeah you have the money to spend the following week we're we're going to be um the only bad thing is Holland's had all preseason Holland is saying he's fit did you see the quote the other day about like I'm playing nigle three there I'm there I'm doing all this stuff and I'm like smash this weekend I I you have no idea how much I want like a 6 nil I'm sorry Ivan I really am but but but we just watched we just literally you know watched Watkins place with 60 minutes where he was terribly flat and then Durant come on and was fantastic and I'm like we're not there yet in 90 minute Ole maybe we don't get to 90 minute Ole maybe they decide that they're going to use him a little less so they can use him a bit more through the European games Champions League O's going to want to smash it up in the Champions League it's going to be all over that um yeah we haven't got enough information yet I think to be able to say that Harland to Watkins is going to be an easy move no okay fair enough I'm just wondering um might be harand to vardy by then anyway mate oh God we're not I don't think we're going there mate to be honest as much as you might say we might I don't think we are we leave at that L we uh yeah I got nothing else to say so uh good luck for game week two mate good luck mate triple Captain active triple Captain M it's been active since like Sunday after Sunday afternoon in fact in fact it was active before I left Fest I think on Friday it's active it is active it's not going anywhere so come on erling see you Sunday cheers man

like yes we've got something to talk about exactly and as I said I've said like all the way through preseason it's just like once we're there then I'm then I'm good then I'm good and uh yeah it's a obviously really interesting interesting weekend um big weekend big weekend lots of I wouldn't say surprises but some things that are interesting that have stood out um particularly in terms of like clean sheets and stuff like that and obviously the you know the impact that that has on like bonus and stuff like that which is you know that's that's interesting to talk about and um and yeah so I've just I've just literally landed back at home um from like a 9 and a half or 11 hour drive and how many how many miles did you do today 500 75 with two kids two kids three stops yeah it was good it was good we just absolutely flew up definitely the best run we had definitely the best run we had how was your day today it was good I had a really casual day like golf watch the football nice easy peasy mate easy peasy it's good let's just say hello to everyone in the YouTube chat um shout out to everyone who's here already uh really appreciate you being here as always this is our gameweek reaction if you haven't been here before so every Sunday night we will come here and we will talk about the football that has happened over the weekend uh some good takes some bad takes our game we scores and

know it's back normal service has has resumed so I don't think we should go any further without talking about just briefly just briefly just briefly on fantasy football Fest good night well good afternoon have B all yeah yeah I mean I was a bit later than everybody else I've got there about fiveish but for the evening yeah incredible I love it like it's weird we got I got there and then we had to go straight up on stage and yeah that wasn't that wasn't expect try explaining that to your friends that you went on stage and someone put a microphone and you had to talk through who you picked in a fancy tapam I tried tried to tell people that this morning when I was playing golf and they looked at me like you you're a nerd and I'm like yeah yeah absolutely I'm a nerd yeah no it was no it was good the problem the problem that I had is I'd already had about seven pints before I turned up that's that's kind of on me I'll give you that but I mean like what we need to say is we need to shout out to every single person almost every single person that was wearing wearing an above average FPL sticker so many so many especially Matt especially Matt so Matt could be anyone Matt could be anyone well his name is probably Matt so but he was wearing a sticker yeah we can't be responsible for that um yeah so uh yeah it was a good it was a good uh good I chat to a bunch of people chatted to uh chatted to three guys that came across from from the US um one guy from La I think it was La yeah la and uh and two guys that come off across from Texas they had season tickets so two of them had a season ticket at Arsenal and one of them had a season ticket at Spurs and they were like it's like $45,000 to get anywhere near just to get a license to get anywhere near a season ticket for the NFL he says this is much cheaper these guys fly across absolutely bizarre yeah it's mad though like we think it's ridiculous but I don't know FPL is Big right I saw you know I'm old but I still see some of these these younger thing so I saw stormy's Tik Tok and he was like I've had the most amazing week like like so like number one all of this and then he's like and also my number one's back FPL yeah that's rul brilliant FL around doing this backbone's out oh yeah and fpl's back oh yeah and and and we and obviously Dean Ashton like and Dean Ashton hopefully Dean's listening to this right now that was that was amazing turns up buys a ticket turns up and uh and just just enjoys chatting with absolutely everyone and he had time for everyone anyone that came and spoke to him was if if I was that good-look I'd have time for everyone yeah really goodl looking yeah yeah yeah so um yeah if you are listening Dean hello and um yeah so I guess what we'll do is we'll just just go to the mini league if you haven't joined the mini league so I'm not going to show the mini league but you know if you haven't joined the mini league then the mini league code is m gork 2 and that will be open as we've said until the Wild Card window shuts at the end of game week 19 and then yeah and then you're in basically so go and join the mini league basically that's about it um and then diving straight in we'll start with uh we'll start with my team which everyone saw on on stage weird but uh so I've got so I'll read it out for people who are listening so I've got David ryer in goal eight points um so obviously got the double clean and got the double clean from Arsenal because I had Gabrielle I had uh I had Trent an eight points really good to see Trent play actually so anyone didn't know obviously I was at Portman Road on on Saturday which was amazing so thanks to thanks to the guys over at sare for that opportunity that was amazing and I got to take Ivan as well so um yeah Ivan had a really good day and uh yeah it was it was it was just a lot of fun um so that's I've got P porro to play tomorrow I've got Gibbs whitean yeah let me I'll get I'll get there mate I'll get there I'll get there Gibbs white um you know I mean he's got three good fixtures so this is fine Gordon not ideal that uh sh gets sent off but I suppose for people who have more than one newcast last it I've done I've done all right out of that fixer in truth um jotter obviously you know that could have been more that header that he missed I mean I was literally right behind it I could see right across it it was a unbelievable Miss uh Bruno I mean obviously I C Bruno for The Vibes and the fun as well as it's being a good pick picks up like just over one xgi and no idea how he doesn't get double digits is what it is really with that one um yeah C Xiao Pedro everyone else seems to score but him so perfect and then Harland does Harland salanki tomorrow you know hopefully we get something good from that and then my bench is full of people that I don't want to play this week so that's fine marvelous and they're ready to come in tomorrow so I've got I got 50 points at the at the moment with a couple to play I I'm ranked 5 million or something I don't know whatever doesn't really matter um yeah and uh SIM justers for the Super Chat uh we'll just leave that there um I think so the average is 50 points on live FPL the okay the average only has one player to go um but included in that one player to go is about 20% worth of picks that didn't play so like 12% of the game had trippier didn't play so there is still some Auto subs and all that stuff will happen um and yeah we've got um I think about 30% of the games got parro and about same on on salanki maybe a little bit less 10% got Sun so having both almost almost guarantees that it'll be an above average week for both of us sounds good on brand week one that's what we like to see there you go here's your teammate couple of extra points but not much more than that um I went with the goalkeeper amnesty of pick Henderson because if we all pick him and he's 4.5 then hey no one wins no one loses um porro to play uh Hall really gets away with Five Points like I was serious I was seriously refreshing like hoping that he would get get taken off and then I saw um I saw a tweet saying Lloyd Kelly's warming up and I was like yes get off that pitch I I saw your message to Ivan that said l was warming up and I was like oh no yeah yeah he's he's off get off that pitch get off that pitch um uh and then obviously once once he was off the pitch obviously wanted wanted uh wanted have him to the score but hey c um Gabrielle gets a clean um and then yeah Gordon sacka and kungu is one you know everyone's going to have to talk about now um J and then the St cap in Harland so yeah soank empir for us to come Spurs for us to come lovely doing a weekend Pod without us having it ruined by Spurs but let's see how we go let's see how we go let's see how we go tomorrow um yeah hopefully hopefully we just get we just get lots of points from from tomorrow I'm assuming that we're not going to be troubled by Skip uh turning up tomorrow lunchtime or tomorrow evening and uh yeah and getting involved can you imagine facing a Midfield of skip and Winks be weird wouldn't it be so bizar I can do that I can do that after I can do that after so let's start with game week uh sorry first game of the game week um we'll go to Manchester United and Fulham now the XG plots are back so thanks again to C out for this um images on the screen if you don't know are the players that pulled out the max bonus so Josh XY here uh with the last minute well not last minute last five minute winner um as called by Ashton about 40 minutes to go he was like they're going to scrape a last minute winner absolutely nailed it um but honestly should have been more Bruno should have scored a couple and I was absolutely gutted by that yeah I mean you watch it and you were like yes like all the good stuff was Bruno like and and and on the end of a lot of good stuff you know um for those that sort new or I would like some reminders some good play that we go to to be able to get our pod out in a really quick time um and some sources one of the sources we love to use is um uh a Twitter account called Mark R statbot um and it his automated account will show things like pass Maps um how teams are in and out possession um as well as things like the XG plots and also expected threet um and what I really noticed looking at man united was L the best shape I've seen from a man united team and as long as I can remember um and it just it started making me think I was like is Bruno the problem like when he's in Midfield is he the issue actually in a strange way because he wants the ball so he drops on the ball he he goes back into Midfield and then he's up to the 10 is it actually better to just have Mount as the 10 even if doesn't do that much um and then just stick Bruno up top um like and if he is if he's doing this every week and he's he's doing this you got to have him yeah he's he's in great positions he's in great positions I mean obviously you know as as we know it it did it does mean that he has to return if he wants to get involved in the bonus conversation though because his his Baseline was really really low like it was it was down there with the with the striker sort of level when I saw it I think it was about six or seven or something like that yeah but everybody goes up this is what we've seen throughout the whole week is if you score you're in the equation if you score now you're in the equation because you you just get that a little bit extra um and so xery comes on scores thanks very much I am taking that bonus yeah um it's it's you know how it is but look if he's going to play false 9 it makes a lot of sense for him to do so um but they all all of them could have Garo could easily easily have made you know more of his is he had some big opportunities and obviously the big one at the end with rashford you know potentially squaring it to him yeah puts that away crazy G puts that away bear in mind he's 6.5 right what do you think everyone be doing today yeah yeah exactly and maybe that's what people should do anyway like I think you know as people are going to look around but maybe that's the one maybe that's the one you know at that price but Bruno 8.5 yeah good yeah yeah good I mean Fulham interesting I thought I thought they caused them a probably more trouble at times you know in terms of the amount of sort of threat they had than the XG that they returned but Robinson looked fantastic you know he was on for two bonus until until the go winning yeah um so and I do think right we we'll probably say this quite a lot but you know like in FPL where if you have it if you have hits you'll put your score and you'll be like I've got 62 minus 4 yeah yeah I'm going to quote repeatedly people's baselines minus with the minus yeah for for what they are so if they don't concede he has a Baseline of 18 cuz that is actually the one that matters because once they concede you ain't getting bonus it's not happening exactly so so look at the one without the big minus points now for for the goal conceded was it three point three for goal conceded minus four minus four so 18 minus four yeah yeah but but that's why that's why we're all looking that's why we've all sort of started with like big Defenders right it's because the cleans are so important and you know that lent into my thinking around like the ryer and Gabrielle double up so but yeah no Robinson good Obviously good fix just coming up um Leicester next week and then ipwi in game week three what are we thinking about like Smith row obviously starts with Pereira comes off early Muniz comes off early like is that is that an issue because obviously people are going Chris Wood Muniz type things right that's another one yeah yeah so we're gonna look at this and and we'll talk through all of those ones but when you think about it like Chris Wood scores so he's the best but Chris Wood had one shot one shot yeah 0.7 XG but he one shot done and came off after 70 minutes but he's obviously the better pick because he scored yeah but like Mo has got lesser next week if he scores is he the better pick you know um it's we are in noisy times but do you expect the expected do I expect the expected minutes to be for minut is about 78 minutes like it was yeah I think that is right I think Jim will come on for the last 15 minutes in most games um does matter against the promoted sides though I mean when I say well okay does it matter against against the with the games with the easier fixure so because like most things we're see we're thinking with the starter if they if the damage is done by it come by the time it comes to like 70 minutes right he gets his goal 25th minute or whatever then it doesn't actually matter that he's only going to play 70 because he's going to be in the bonus conversation at that point anyway as well obviously other stuff can happen but exactly it's fine me it's fine um and Smith row so we've seen the quote about building minutes what he got 64 so your first tick is did he come off pre 60 no good yeah that's good it um do we know they've got four sort of Playmakers in um Smith row we've got Wilson we've got Kenny we've got PR yes they got four so do I expect them to be some rotation and some limited minutes across them yes yeah is it likely to mean but but what you really want from Smith row is that he doesn't get injured my only reason why I didn't go Smith row was like if he gets injured in the first week I'm stuffed yeah like I didn't have enough cover to do it so so my Smith row potenti of dma which I wish I had now was I was looking at maybe Inu to Smith row and I would have done Gabrielle to Trent that's what I would have done and that would have been beneficial I wish I had done that um but if Smith got injured with that then I would have been straight into playing sangar yeah so so in the end I was like okay I'll go with a higher one because I can actually go off to to someone else on this one um but I think if you've got Smith rowers like you've got where you had him on the bench and you got the choice of bringing them on you're a bit more flexible with it so it's it's fantastic um yeah would you expecting to be like 75 minutes home to Leicester probably yeah probably is that pretty good it's pretty good yeah pry good it's prettyy good we will take it we'll take that yeah um any other any other ones we need to look at mrai obviously like obviously at top bonus and then and then comes comes down after fbl sort their [ __ ] out yeah yeah how confident are you by the way in all of your gameweek one pronunciations I always like gameweek one at the start because I'm like I'm going to say mazwi that's what I was going to say I'm like I don't know say Mai X he just felt like a better a yeah yeah that's what it did feel like it was was that he he's like quite efficient in his passing he is really good one Defender four tackles is a lot um but maybe he got a load of tackles because that's the side they're going to attack down Robinson iobi they like dribbling so you they will get some more tackles in so it's a one game sample I start saying he's definitely the bonus King it was always likely to be that way the interesting probably thing on Defenders for this was that castana didn't play and that Kenny T played instead yeah yeah move on to the game you went to move on to the game I went to yeah this was I mean I mean the The Vibes around the game was were amazing the crowd were were were absolutely brilliant and they were loving it and you know obviously the way the first half started was was incredible it switch setup BAS basically from minute one in a 424 and just went you ain't getting past us like they just went man for man it's literally on the pitch and was just like well our four guys will do what they need to do at the back but actually what we'll do is we'll throw another guy forward to actually join the press and I sent you a photo from a Liverpool goal kick and they had seven men within 30 yards of the goal it was it was literally insane Lally but 30% 20 30% of the time they they won the ball back high like really high and it forced Liverpool to you know forc Liverpool to make decisions to go high and long early which I don't think slot wanted to do right we talked about talk preseason about how we were going to see more buildup from Liverpool they didn't have the opportunity to do that at all in the first half um and so Diaz was getting a lot of the ball and Salah was getting a lot of the ball but they were mainly long and they were kind of isolated in the first half Robo did well to support Diaz but Salah basically was like front foot like head towards leaf Davis and quite often just got his feet stuck and he didn't really look sharp at all Salah and that didn't really change throughout the whole game as ridiculous as as his points Hall looks and yeah you know that they had chances obviously but what I found was that the confidence um in attacking the Liverpool goal was just not there it was like so basically it was like they'd run a marathon by the time they got to the Penalty area and their legs just couldn't remember how to kick the ball so Hutchinson did it a couple of times where he literally he took a bad touch and Trent could have nicked it off him but Trent backed off and then he tried to make the pass out wide to to Davis and it was just the worst pass just went out straight out for a goal kick and that happened a few times I mean even hinson's shot um on Allison was you know kind of weak the the big chance that they had they need to start they need to start running across Defenders like with the ball to try and get contact or something because Defenders will either make an unbelievable tackle and if they do then hands up or they will they'll bring bring you down or they'll let you go um but second half they changed shape I don't think Liverpool changed too much but I switch definitely changed shape they went more uh more more 42 31 and it kind Liverpool were able to pass around that basically once they did that um salah's movement off the ball is literally Elite like he's just unbelievable and he had he had Davis timing of the run is just ridiculous that was the thing so for the goal I thought he'd gone too early and then before I knew it the ball was through and there a center back had dropped a couple of yards and he was just in and that was it like jot was obviously just sitting there jot misses the chance a couple of minutes before but he's just sitting there um ready ready to take it and then you know the second goal goes in and it's it's pretty it's pretty rudimentary from there from Liverpool I mean they they they closed out the game really well really professionally and like the whole game was great though like the whole game was great I mean the I fans were fantastic um Liverpool fans Liverpool way fans were crap actually until they scored they were just proper crap like like literally crap it there was there was a there was some bits where it did get a bit Qui but I noticed that in a few places today I mean Chelsea I felt that was unbelievably quiet today really like it it was it was really really really quiet but yeah I think this and we'll remember when we get to the just people remember that are looking at this like is is when you get to the Newcastle Southampton game because I think it plays into that same deal is that promoted teams for the first half hour go at it like because they're used to winning they're used to dominating teams they know what they're doing they know what they're all about they would they would go at it what I don't think they necessarily probably realized was the focus is on big and the ref went bookings really early like that first booking with wolfen done was early I I didn't surprise that you I didn't really see the need for the wolfing done booking but then suddenly he does that one and then it's another one and then it's Burns gets booking which was naughty the break down the Achilles yeah but then because he's gone early on the bookings he's like oh no I need to slow down and he didn't and he didn't book anyone until gakpo in like this was no it wasn't gakpo yeah it was gakpo in like the 80th minute I don't know how much you could see it but burn should have been off he handall it was a deliberate handle as J went through the uh yeah I didn't really see it but you could see it from me could it was such an obvious reach back to do to get it he should have been off but I guess V can't look at it because it's a yellow yellow but the ref given the hand ball yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah no he literally gave the hand ball I mean I think and I think I think the ref just bowled it I think the ref just bowled it he was like I can't send off one of these one of these guys in the first but he should have sent him off so but what I did notice is every time you get a book it's harder to press isn't it when you've been booked you can't do it you can't do stuff and I feel like it I feel like there was I know everyone's going to say slot did this and he changed this and do this stuff but I also think naturally Liverpool were going to be better in the second half even if you did nothing like this potentially would happen because they're really good players and they work would have worked out ways to get on top um one of one of the really good things I liked for jotter not NE necessarily from an FPL perspective but he held his run quite often so that Diaz and Salah could go so sometimes the ball would go and he would be the lone Runner and he would go and they would stop but when he then stopped center backs had to go and almost every time Salah got in it was because J stopped and it did make me think Darwin won't do that Darwin's always yeah he's always towards and it did make me think I'm not sure he's the type of for wants you know I know gakpo did come out and say that slot sees him more as a left Winger but I also think he probably also suits Center forward pretty well as well yeah um it did it I think it's a positive um you know J's J's had 0.95 XG he's had the most XG in the game um yeah that big chance was massive as well for him like both both his chances like both his chances were pretty much at the same place yeah yeah it's but you're going to want him if he's going to get into that position right and the thing about the thing do you think two years ago Salah would have pass that or do you think he with a shot I think I was having this conversation actually Danny earlier about like is he now going to be a boneless monster type something I said actually's been all right for a couple of years because he's been pretty good creative creatively for the last couple of years but when he side foots it to jotter it goes in the net when he side foots it to DAR when it doesn't always go in the net um um and so if J's played up front for him do I think Salah will get more points yeah yeah I do because J did the hold up run which allowed Salah to get through so then you're like I need them all I need them all but I also want Trent and Al and also Diaz was Diaz's got 13 Baseline for a guy that's playing Left forward that's pretty good um yeah there's there's a lot of attract in this team what I noticed um more than anything was the quality of chance so I listen to um the guy Josh Williams uh who's at distance covered um he did a pod with prano our friend for the FPL um really brilliant about As Good As It Gets In terms of Liverpool views but he said about you know we average over 20 shots a game under klopp um I think it might be less than that and it was it was 18 that sounds terrible it sounds terrible but it's basically like 0.15x Jeep a shot that's big yeah that's big you know so so last season um Newcastle brenford and Tottenham were were the best at XG like 0.12 0.13 um if they're fashioning high quality chances the front fre will just get an unbelievable amount of goals so 2xg came from those front fre you want two of them yeah you you're quite happy if they're going to generate those kind of numbers 18 at 0.15 per thing and the majority of the shots going to come from those run three you kind of want two of them you know is is Arsenal took the same number of shots so we can go to them next yeah um they had half the XG before we move to Arsenal we need to talk about Quanza is he just like dead now like like cuz I did enjoy I did enjoy the fact that that we spoke to we spoke when we spoke to case we were saying how like quite upfront and honest and blunt the Dutch can be they can and uh they can and he was like he literally was he was I mean I don't know I mean he I don't know whether he was on like um he's getting paid for the amount of times that he said Jews in that interview though because he did say it about 23 times did uh even even talking about something else but yeah but coming out and saying that didn't win enough Jews fair enough um dap did have him a little bit on the ropes he did in in in that aspect of the game I thought he passed the ball all right but yeah is that is that a risk is that a worry or is that just do you think maybe like that's just a team specific thing the way IP switch set up might be very specific I think it's more that thing yeah that is the thing like what do you do now because he hasn't got so Joe Gomez wants to leave so he's only got three center backs you can't really afford to piss one off yeah not not piss piss one off so is it you're young but that wasn't strong enough I'm taking you off now but I'm putting you back in or is it canot isn't is the more established Defender yeah and that's just how it is you know was he was he effectively punishing canato than punching Quanza that's the other part we don't know so was it quite close in the first time he said to canate I'm sorry like you not good enough yeah maybe but then he's builing like we don't know any of this stuff he's been quite Frank but I do think he's he's quite happy to really interesting I think what we see from him is he's actually quite open to criticize individuals but when it comes to praise he normally bring it goes it back to the team there was a question there was lots of questions about Salah in particular and he brought that all the way back to the team yeah very true that very true okay cool let's move to let's move to Arsenal I'm now just more than anything I'm just conscious of time because it is quite late and we've got a lot of fixtures to go through we'll go through them all but the wife will want to go to bed so let's go let's move on to Arsenal wolves um a pretty I mean you said they they they created lexg yes true but they did just knock him down right um the the ball in for hav his goal great hav does really well to win that oh really well to win that header um both both got I mean they didn't have more than a 0.25 XG chance all game so you know that's something which you'd like to see more but that is part of we've seen that often with artetta where he will do just absolute domination of grind down with do stuff and he's got some really good finishes hav is really good in the air H he gets a really good goal sack's goal like sack's goal is standard it seems standard doesn't it and then you look at the XG and you go well that only goes in never yeah yeah but it does when he does it because the shot is the the XG is where the position is yeah um but also he does also he doesn't just he doesn't just shoot near post right he shoots both ways so that's the problem with him with Pace yeah yeah he h it hits it hard now I remember saying this a couple of years ago that he he started just actually hitting the ball properly yeah proper bumps it so so when you open the eyes up to go far side and then you bang it harder near post yeah yeah it's Keeper's got no chance that's why he has so many block shots he does have quite a lot of block shots he tries that near post one and the Defenders are just all they're just there right yeah because they're but if it gets through it's it's gone that makes it so hard to defend though because he is so good at that far post one as well like we saw that in the Euros get that's why he get gets a load of points and then defensively I mean like 0 0.4 I think Timber had the only shot from uh other Defenders from an X from a set piece that's weird yeah um so it's weird unusual but that that I'm imagining that will change as we say like multiple targets so yeah they will they will find way to create chances for other players that's for sure y I mean Sak and hav look the best two picks the defense are fantastic because they get loads of cleans they really really good you know wols did have a couple of decent chance OB CA gave one to kuna yeah um Ryan made a good save but it's still less than half an nextg if you do that you're more likely to clean they're not clean yeah um they were late but yeah have sa a we're going to have that this season aren't we where people score so you're like they're the best picks but these two genuinely are the best two picks in this team like if I if I had odard right now yeah he only had that he only had that free kick right so that's it free kick it that's it .02 XG nothing um yeah that is that is a little bit concerning if you were to if you were to own it when I was very very close to having him very close yeah if you own own odard over Bruno Fernandez this week you'd be like yeah and I from a points perspective I almost had him over J um which was obviously it would have been better even even that would have looked terrible yeah you would be that would you would be getting you'd be getting real jittery him going to Villa this weekend but but hey he's a really good player his Baseline was still really high if he scores he'll get double digits yeah but um yeah I'm not I'm not convinced on it and Martin just got left down that left side just running just it's just basically a further left back cuz the left back doesn't go far enough forward um I don't think they can keep playing Thomas party I know he play came out but he just it just stands out as bad compared to the rest of the te like he's the one where it's like they won't do that for long if they can sign Marino then yeah they'll still I suspect they played party one of the things about is this just hav as number n every game you suspect it is cuz he's so good at it but I don't think rice had the legs to play six in this game you know hence why he came off um which is unusual but I think once he has the legs to play six then maybe maybe Kai goes back to them to yeah eight occasionally not very often but occasionally or even just later in the game and stuff he did do it later in this game um yeah we just got note from bitman just he just says that Gabrielle did have a header from a corner um 1.3 1.1 sorry 1.1 0.13 XG chance in the 55th minute which is on here actually yeah so just to just a note Gabrielle uh not SL in this case but they were like 20 to 30% of their XG was coming from was coming from set pieces and that did not happen yeah but hey Villa up next I'm sure villa villa you know notoriously bad as set pieces so um people have got decision on this so you will play Robinson next week I will play Robinson yeah most likely over Pedro Jia Pedro oh you'll go down up so you'll still keep you'll still play Gabriel yeah yeah I think so yeah yeah I'll still go so you'll play Gabrielle way over Jo Pedro at home to man united yeah yeah I think yeah just think the floors the floors is obviously I think the floor is just higher right I know obviously Dilla scored scored this week they were okay but um that Arsenal defense is really really good like it's just a really really good defense and when you have when you have really good Defenders like like pick the good players that do the good stuff is is quite it's quite a simple way of looking at it and Harry is just messag to say he has Gabriel on his bench there's going to be a few that have that decision yeah well that's fine I don't I don't look don't don't don't copy what I do yeah I'm trying to copy what you do Harry that's what I'll put Hall on the bench rather than Gabrielle this week definitely yeah definitely well let's go to them should we Newcastle sou this gu Newcastle Southampton no that's not Newcastle Southampton that is Everton Brighton that's Newcastle Southampton did I get the order wrong oh dear okay Newcastle Southampton well clearly Southampton are a much better team than Newcastle evidently from from from the XG plot absolutely zero context to add sell them all sell all your Newcastle they're done two shots one goal yeah I mean like like there is there is zero relevance In from from a Newcastle perspective there is zero relevance at looking at this kind of data unfortunately so it's really hard to to sort of make any kind of argument um I guess just the fact that they won the game is just one of those things that is what football's about type thing it's like you know it's not a it's not a data Le thing right it's all it's just sometimes this happens in football right yeah where you don't concede and you just you just literally n you literally grind it out Newcastle if I had a look at the um so the the pass map for the Newcastle game normally it's up until the first substitution but because of the red card this was from when they went down to 10 men up until like the 75th minute and the pass map has like zero passes between any of the players and they're in the most ridiculous formation you've ever seen um oh it's their baselines were through the floor because no one got past completion out yeah yeah oh yeah of course like burn and Hall were like You' think oh they got loads of blocks and stops no they just they just stayed and just hoped for the best they got like two and six you know what I mean it was absolutely no chance whatsoever but yeah so we could say that hey they weren't very good for 30 minutes but we've just spoke for 20 minutes about why Liverpool are good yeah Liverpool were no good for 30 minutes yeah because they were playing a PRI team the PRI team came out really hard really fast um and they struggled against it they struggled against it they you know and share Sher is stupid he's stupid like no it's so stupid because let's not pretend it's the first time that a player has gone into a into a moment like that and then one of them comes out well we see we see video crap of both players doing exactly the same thing I'm sure I've seen a video where both players go heads in and then both just fall to the floor like that because they're just trying to get the other guy set off it's always happened but when when someone he's so far off the ball like it's 30 yards away from the foul and he pushes double-handed pushes you in the back when someone does that you roll over you don't get up yeah Shar just needs to roll over when he gets pushed over just you've been you've being pushed over he will get booked if you do nothing yeah there's no benefit in you getting up yeah gets up gets into it and he's the only one that loses I genuinely I'd love nothing more than than the ref to send both off because it just makes a weird precedent where South Antman have really benefited from that and then I'm like oh it's not put going to put him off doing that again yeah yeah yeah no I agree yeah I actually agree with that you know because you could book him for the that and then you can also book in for the argument you can book in for both like it might be a two books versus a versus a red but I'd rather you do something to stop that and stamp that stuff out of the game yeah um but what you do know with Diaz is he'll do anything he don't care like it like and that can sometimes be good for for being an FPL asset because you're he's 5.5 in a mid yeah it's pretty good Armstrong though had more shots so that's still the thing yeah five shots from Armstrong compared to two from Diaz yeah 0.7 XG from Armstrong versus 0.3 Armstrong is the one on pens yeah he's still the Talisman and the other thing on Diaz is he came off on 71 minutes for Archer because they just signed Archer yeah that's potentially a problem all those things could uh could be an issue yeah agreed uh shout out Roberto for share saying he wishes he could turn back time Sensational comment that one love it no no no no mat the day used that oh did they no that's regurgitation don't get okay fair enough I not see match of the day he's done me absolutely done me cool right let's move on to let's move on to Everton versus Brighton um I mean there was a lot of talk about how much better Everton could be defensively I know obviously branway didn't play which probably was a big factor but Brighton came to play um M before he goes off looks extremely Lively obviously gets the assist for the MoMA goal I didn't see I say I didn't see um his reaction I heard about his reaction to what was going on do you think there's do you think they're running like full concussion protocol on him is he going to be out for more than a week no don't think so I'm not even even 100% sure it was concussion but it was just signs of concussion so concussion is 6 days but it's how long can he come out it's how long does he have to stay up team training that you just go start a Dinger yeah because a dinger's good um so you know maybe you just the sensible thing is if you're setting up all week with yeah so so it's like a minimum I think I think after three days it then starts you can do this and do this just just Google C protocol there's the whole steps of what you have to do after day one day two day three onwards um but you've got to pass a series of tests on a day-to-day basis and I think it's day six is the first day that you're allowed to keep train okay um but he look great look the The Narrative here is that everturn are an absolute disaster that's the narrative but we all we always say when Michael Keane starts games it's a problem that is a problem that is a problem but they definitely were way too open they were you know quite often going One V one in tackles with really good dribblers which is not very clever um but if you take away the MOBA goal of this if you just imagine if you're watching this just squash down and you take out the 0.8 XG for them time goal it's about a level game yeah and they only had 10 men for so last 25 minutes or so so if you take out that bump yeah everything did all right then then you say oh and also Everton had disect goal offside yeah then they had a penalty I'm really struggling on that penalty it makes me really angry so kav L is touching is is on the ball yeah Lewis dunk slides in y he doesn't get the ball correct Cal Leen stands on his foot and then dun moves the ball which makes caval fall over so he gives the foul and we're going to overturn it but isn't the fact that so cavalo's on the ball a person has put their foot under somebody else's foot and that person's fell over how is it a foul by DCL cuz that person's challenged the man with a and not got the ball yeah I don't know like can you just do that if if I'm if I'm just running into the box I don't have to go at you I just have to slide under your foot as you're running and if you stand on me it's a foul yeah it's so it's still it's still some form of obstruction you you've put yourself put your body under the man it's this ridiculous thing about it's this it's this I I hate the way that they have to word it like the the wording in fre stuff like when you read out the the protocol change last week on penalties I was like they just over complicate it and then we have to use those words and terms like Striker initiated contact like that's that's the one they're going to use right he's he how is he initiated contact when dunk gone to ground is meant if he yeah if if Cal Len wasn't in control of the ball it's a foul by calv Len but because Cal is on the ball dunk is the one challenging him not him him can can we can we also just talk about the fact that ref goes to the Monitor and doesn't see a thing I'm GNA stand there for a bit n turn off it's really weird it's really weird so all of these things happen how does the ref not like so I don't get it I thought I thought they were supposed to be having the referee ref the game yeah like so go back go go back the V Should in my in my mind the V if that's how the like it's written they should go well we think that actually the striker here is initiated the contact because he's trodding on dun's leg can you have a look like can you just do the can you have a look please and not do the [ __ ] yeah like the the pantomime of just walking to the monitor that like it what's so ridiculous like you're getting people like there's phones everywhere people recording this stuff right it's so stupid that it doesn't the ref doesn't look at it and you wonder why it's people people say that it's all corrupt and especially Everton like Jesus Christ I know yeah they' had enough but yeah I feel everon were in The Narrative of straight away on my God Everton it's going to be a long season all that stuff I'm like I'm not so sure that is the case yeah okay on it but you know that obviously the assets we're looking at are more in the Brighton space um Pedro hit the post that's his only shot 0.02 XG shot um but the post with it I think positionally if you look at his past Maps he was more mat 10 type position of sometimes eight sometimes 10 like not the nine um I don't love that wels is scoring I've called him WBS Jesus the F but he did still try and get himself a penalty you I mean he did still get you know turns up turns up the pressure and then tried you know as he as he's tackling with tarkowski he grabs his head St away goes down he'll do anything he can he'll get pens cuz Pedro gets pens that's what he wants more than anything else in the world and he'll take him and he'll score any he gets um matoma four shots over one XG I didn't I didn't realize it recently but mat's 27 yeah yeah he's quite he's quite old like he's a leader in that team now with all those young Lads and stuff and I just it made you think like this is a really big year for him so we've had talks like the last year about you know big moves who might want him and do this stuff this is huge rib if he does want a big move it's this year because after then is sellon dribbly Wingers yeah you don't see many 30 31 year old dribbly Wingers slower and slower and I think salah's a good example of that like he doesn't do that anymore does he not well yeah not not at the end back end of last season not the same way that he did if you think of the was it the city goal that he City goal a few years ago in and out in and out I watched him struggle to try and do that to Leaf Davis on Saturday so yeah you certainly lose a little bit he could just really go really big and he could be all end product and he could you know mature into the world he's in he's 27 he could be pure prime yeah um but he was injured back end of last season right which is why and and we were looking at six FES like Gibbs white and kungu um you know better fixtures and what have you like everyone was just excited by Inu which I mean there's reason to be there was reason to be there is reason to be know um but yeah there were alternative options and and I think it's fair that Xiao Pedro and M were the two that people were looking at from from Brighton I mean no one was looking at Welbeck no one was looking at a dingra dingra ding dingra doesn't start and I guess the reason being they've got a million of these guys as well in that position if you can dribble they're after you they're after you they take them all yeah yeah yeah Brion will um dunk lowest of the baselines of all the Brighton Defenders uh comfortably as well dunk winning a foul incredible yeah velman 21 van heck 16 steel when steel plays like he's whenever we've done our BBS Parts he's is off the charts 19 like so dunk is probably a two or six Defender a lot of the time um and the lastly because they had a red card to Ashley Le young Patterson and colan are not back they're not so sun is really good like if you if you have got saaka and Salah this week Andy Martin for example you've done really really well and you probably haven't got many issues in life what like how do you tackle Harland when he's got IP switch like one way is Captain Salah brenford the other way is oky K and do sacka the son and and Captain him versus Everton when they've got no right back yeah yeah it's kind of especially if you're on Wild Card 4 if you went sackur and Salah and your plan is wild card 4 it could just do it is that worth the transfers there's two you lose two transfers right that's that's your that's your only thing right but you potentially so best caps option in game week one Salah he was um son bar Harland is the second best captain and I would say that sacka is the best captain in game three right now as an option yeah um the issue you've got is if sacka goes up this week you can't get back him you can't get back to him that's very that's that's the potential problem yeah but yeah right four to go four to go Forest versus Bournemouth one shot Chris Wood does the business other than that bourou is still good Bournemouth without salanki still good do we think that's do we think that's opposition should base though cuz I you said Forest a bad well yeah really I'm not not say forest I don't want to say forest are bad but they're not they're not like in the top half premier league right so I think the big context is Deno gets injured that doesn't early on so when one of your defensive midfielders go off it is you know and it's a big injury in that sense yeah in that way as well in particular yeah it it could make a big big difference for them but um seeno led the line I don't know whether he goes back wide once Evan Nelson comes in um but um and then Tav played in the 10 and they both had five shots yeah but tavan a he created three chances he had 60 touches in the 10 that's monstrous mad that's that's loads played they both played 90 minutes you're not going there nah you'd go some men over to have when you but but there be some 5.5 mids in their world um maybe I definitely know don't know how to pronounce him but uh I I want to go Hoon the Bournemouth um left-sided Center back he's he's good poison what like like the source you get with duck H you know Dutch names about the me H UI j s n uh no how maybe I'll ask tomorrow someone do you know what all of the early ones right people do fonetic go in the comments not live chat in the comments and and give us some phonetic spellings yeah I liked him yeah I thought he was I thought he was he was real good moving on are you concerned about Gibs white or is it just no fixes is still fine fixes is still fine so just keep him let him roll let him roll because the first five fixes are really good first five six Mr Lucen does has not helped me in the chat by just spelling his name that does not help how I pronounce his name night H mate I'll find out I'll find out exactly I'll find yes West an Villa a late game let's go Onana early goal petta penalty and theang goal to finish I mean I did didn't see this cuz I was traveling back this was good this is good fun this was great fun um uh four big chances each as you can see by the big jumps in in in these um I think I I still think both teams are if you've got attackers up against West Ham we get to eay in a bit but he's got West Ham um and if you got teams against filler I sacka so we talk like but I Zak I the um you know such such absolutely dominated F like Gabrielle could do exactly what such did he was such had five shots and one XG that's mad like would a from set pieces yeah he was causing he was causing problems more free kicks I think than Conners so but he was he was causing them problems every time cudas got the ball out on that left it was like oh yeah mat cash is right back again um they it just it just it they Fel both teams felt so open once someone started attacking um Bowen though had no shots and off on 73 minutes so could has played full 0 B came off on 73 that's that's mad like welcome to captaincy welcome to Club welcome to Club how how bad is that from a confidence perspective like Well Done Club captain you're off after 73 with the game in the balance like the game's in the balance I me like surely he's fatigued or injured or something yeah surely it doesn't make any sense to do that otherwise some other other um T you know Bailey he went around the keeper he had an open goal um but because it's from wide it's a 0.2 XG but this would be even more in this um God David Louise 2.0 telman had the most Baseline of any player this weekend at 22 played the full nighty and he's probably on pens yeah he's on pens probably yeah like if it starts happening we have to tell ourselves that it's not we just can't be Doug Louise blind if it start starts happening I still think with Villa though you I still think we have to wait until the Champions League yeah but I know I know the fixes start well from three and he's he gets injured a bit as well if you want to go in on on Villa that's fine I mean that's fine 3 four five but as soon as the Champions League starts things are going to start looking a bit dicey you know you're going to start seeing rotation and stuff that they have to eight big games in that comp and yeah I mean I we'll have to wait and see I mean did um when Matson came on where did he come on SO Matson came on at left back for Dena okay but I think I think the more interesting piece for for Matson when he came on was that Jacob Ramsey also came on the left side so the goal the winning goal is made by Matson pushing the ball in to Ramsey who pushes the ball on to Durant yeah and Rogers started Rogers was brilliant like he was brilliant he looks the part he will play a lot of minutes he played all nighty um he played out wide on the left and then he came into the 10 um yeah he's excellent he is excellent but I did think to myself I back Matson to take the position off of Dena if I have Matson then I would rather have Ramsey in front of him then I would rather have Rogers in front of him and then if he's there then it's like oh we saw it last season didn't we like you remember when they when bayy and dii both played they would play them both on the right weirdly yeah um it was yeah it's like he doesn't almost like a left Winger he wants a left inside attacking mid which Ramy fit well so I can have an overlap of the left Winger I thought Ramsey was good when he came on I thought maton was good but I thought they he looked like the players that as soon as they're fit enough those two take that position and I'm like what does that mean for Rogers does Rogers goes back to being like a 25 30 minute man and comes on for Bailey and the time we won him is like gameweek three game we four so would I say for example taking kungu out this week for Rogers and try and get some money let's see his minutes in a couple of games yeah because it's Arsenal this week we can afford to wait yeah let's just see let's see how it was but I mean Watkins didn't look sharp I was very surprised that they took Watkins and um mcin off you know that's at one all that's not what expect numbers were like no shots no basically nothing like like hardly any invol whatsoever but he's a blood he's such a good manager is he that's how he's got him forth like away from home in first game of the season you take mcin and Watkins off and win win the match yeah yeah yeah fair play yeah like it's it's um it's there lots of people with kza pal Torres he was up there he was involved in every set piece his Baseline is 20 compared to kano's 14 that's 20us 4 14 but um but the Baseline for p because he's such a good player and they're the same price I PES okay fair enough but you know if you need a 4.5 in gameweek four I think it'll be PES over um on to today on to today um yeah uh I I can't comment on this game you driving I was literally driving literally driving for yeah 11 hours so my my um my knowledge of this game is basically the well I've seen the goals um yeah so should we just get the elephant out in the room out there like the most ridiculous decision or the yeah the N goal n goal non goal non shot non anything which was obviously uh a calamitous joke because and we were talking about this before the before we started right obviously this is the instruction that the referees have given that that if you know we spoke about it talking about penalties right and you said there was going to be more on blocks infringements and blocking runs and things like that so the instruction is clearly to you know blow up for these immediately whereas in almost every other scenario on the pitch they wait until something comes especially in an attacking situation like that where it could go in the net so that gives them the opportunity to then look at it like it just boggles the mind that they actually decide in this instance to to actually just blow the whistle and then obviously because the ball's already sorry because the whistle is already blown before the ball's in the net there's literally nothing they can do cuz the game stopped yeah if I was trying to give some sympathy to refs and I don't often do this but because the ball is so wide I don't think he thinks that E's got it in his locker to even shoot like it it looks where is it looks like it's going to come in for a cross so if in his brain it's coming in for a cross and he blows early then he's kind of done the right thing but unfortunately because he's just G on all right cuz Mark fle think oh I can just I can just whack it the goal and hits an unbelievable shot and I think that's why they had such a weird pause because I think he was almost apology to himself it was like God I wish I hadn't blown that whistle so soon but I definitely blew it before it went in the net so they checked it for ages about whether whether he' blown the whistle or not cuz I reckon if they hadn't then he would have been like yeah yeah okay to overturn it I think you know I think he felt stupid I think he's gone I've been given a Direction which is punish these things the ball's about to come in there's clearly a block there I'm going to do this but actually when you look at it the blocks a bit there and it's nothing to do with the goal because the goal's G the ball's gone straight in in the net well this is this is it it sounds it sounds to me like it sounds to me like once again we come across something where like not enough questions it hasn't been stress tested enough like what I know you can only have so many scenarios that you can run through before you implement something right but surely the scenario is wide free kick player shoots is versus crosses is one you should probably look at right what should we do in this situation I doubt they did that I think that's it how how how does that happen though at this level when there's so much money on the line like how does it happen in this kind of business genuinely it's it's literally sense it doesn't make sense aside from that it doesn't make sense but other than that even when you take that off he had seven other shots he had seven other shots yeah you know like like it's like half an XG it's not like they were but he's so good at shooting so like his free kick that that was low and just went wide you know and and all of it is you're like he's just bloody good and now the Clause has gone that's so we've talked about but the claws has gone they're more like to sell gay now they can't afford to sell him um it's yeah it's um I hate not own him him you yeah I don't like not owning him just just just from a talismanic point of view obviously Mata comes off early he does start which I thought was really interesting comes off early he's obviously just tired like man's tired man's tired but uh but yeah you know once they get him up and running then that's probably better for as well just from a from an assist point of view uh there's a comment in there about Henderson being pretty poor for the second goal I think he does all right given that it's deflected it's probably pretty SL done him it just changed the pace he's already he's already on the floor at that point right so there's only so much power you can get with your hand can he maybe get it another yard further away maybe in the moment but he just tries to get as much as he can on it and I don't he's trying to Palm it against whis's ankle for Christ's sake so no hson like the first the first first goal the position is weird he's not again he's not helped by the defender who's standing in front right directly in between him and that so it's like Defender needs to go at bumo to make sure he hasn't got the ability to play around him as soon as the the defender stands halfway in between boomo just got to go around him by the time it's around him he's not he's only he's only seeing it once it's gone past him it's you're going to get that with like know we say with sacka the way sacka obviously finishes it and uh and stuff so there will be there will be times when both player and keep Defender and keeper go wider and Boomer just whacks it in near post instead but I think they're very difficult to defend because you've got to defend both sides somehow yeah May closer had to gamble though he had to gamble he basically had to go you know what I'm going to get out of the way of this Defender CU he's the one who he's like if you can't see it you've got to gamble yeah even if you open up your near side just gamble it like do something but standing where you were was Sitting Duck he was pretty he was pretty crappy but bumo and WIA now Tony looks like hey not involved and Frank dunis there CU Frank said how good he trained on Thursday and how great he was looking so yeah it's um it's it's a problem but really high baselines they're going to be involved in it they're going to take the bonus in a lot of games um yeah they're really good value booma but the the fixtures aren't quite there like like you said it's one good one is against Palace but then it's Liverpool then it's um a good fixture then it's City it's just a bit icky and and that was that was like the decision around the keeper more than anything actually I wasn't I wasn't against going for fleen um I was against going for f of course you were yeah that was expected mate the whole Community I hate Henderson do you remember when we used to wear that white cap do you remember when he used to wear a cap like it wasn't like so I hate him for that I hate the short sleeves of Fleck and the C of Henderson like am all yeah order keepers are bad moas Mo yes people are going to say that it's three at the back and then they're the wing backs it's the wing backs in defense yeah but in attack again got look our friend Mark our stat spot I have a look at his pass map it's effectively 424 in attack yeah yeah Richards goes across to the right Mitchell stays where he is at left back but Munos just go right wing so e goes to the left wing Munos goes to the right wing kamalo joins joins matto in in the middle he's a right winger yeah if they start dominating games they're in they're going to yeah it's unbelievable Great Value um the question is is you know whether they'll clan um and there's still that problem of if you've got Henderson as well like like me do you want a double want D do you want a double I mean the fixes aren't the fixes are all right to be fair like because they don't have any big they don't have any big swings anywhere at all so you can almost carry carry them through I mean later on in the season gets a bit sticky in the in in the run in or whatever that's miles away but West Ham Home Chelsea away fine you you'd probably move to a different Defender there if you had like a Robinson for example yeah and then Leicester and man United at home Everton away Liverpool at home Forest away so yeah their fixtures are all right to be fair yeah but like can you I don't think at any point in the season I would have been here talking about I should be doubling up on like like if you're if you're not doubling up on Arsenal defense like just don't [ __ ] double up on crystal palace defense Christ but but the fact I know the money is different everybody's got Henderson do you know what I mean like literally the majority of the game has got Henderson like you're a weird though like if you haven't got Henderson that's that's the basic of it but you are like like like it is like like literally like less than 15 20% of people don't have erson that's something I'm say that's why I say it's a keeper amnesty we've all just decided don't bother don't bother Keepers just just stick him in like um and it's lost don't it's lost if people spent the money anyone spent more money so far if you spent the money on Pope you spend the money on Allison you spent the money on Riot on you know these good defenses guess what get you more points um so that's not you know weird is good like like that's working out well but like every like person that was like yeah I hate all Keepers I'm not going to bother they went I'm just going to stick heners in it so so it's not it's not the huge huge problem um but munas is is he's the stand out at 5.0 he's a stand out 5.0 final game on onto the last so you haven't gotten Inu I do not have Inu and kungu comes off before 60 Minutes 58 minutes and kungu how did he play I thought he was excellent I thought he played really good it it my biggest worry about anunu is the that he came off and he came off poor niic Jackson because if we start on Chelsea that they should have scored multiple times in that first half they should have scored multiple times but they didn't even get the shot off or when they did it turned out it was offside and it was offside because niik Jackson was always offside yeah he's always off there was the one weird play where it went on forever before they finally put the flag up but and he just is one of the world's worst decision makers on earth like you give him the ball and he's just like you know like the five side kid who never passes but always you know says to you then yeah I've scored 18 goals you're like yeah man everyone hates you yeah that that's that's how I would have felt if I was in kungu and Palmer with Nico Jackson that first half he he just did so many stupid things and stupid decisions and and it looks more works because inu's movement was so clever like you could tell he's of like you know full on Red Bull sort of type player you know I mean that that type stuff the movement was brilliant off off injured though Jackson uh I don't know I mean sofa score I'm yeah I'm just looking at sofa score s score no no no I don't think so but I assumed once I suddenly saw that that Netto was getting um was warming up and I was thinking well this makes so much sense because they're getting into all the right positions but they're wasting it when they get there and you you bring natto on you take Jackson off you put unko up top and then that didn't happen he took off andu and then eight minutes later he then takes off Jackson and you're like what why did you why because literally a minute after is see that massive chance there yeah Jackson yeah there's so Harry's asking about that because it's there's actually an Enzo Miss there for with from a header which is 0.13 and then Jackson's 6 so that's why that's there two starts Jack there's two chances in that minute if he just done the other way which is the way that any Sur I reckon you could ask a million people that are watching that game and what they would have done is put unko up and and and took Jackson off and nto and then anunu is in that position it's a goal yeah and they're back in that game it made no sense it made absolutely no logical sense you're like oh we've got a manager that Leicester fans I keep playing back Ivan's conversation Lester fans were calling for his head and mainly because he's dull and he plays dull football so when he lined up today with three defensive midfielders I was like oh God oh God and then when he did that before doing that move I'm like oh God yeah like it was time for Quality do they were there for them do we again think that's opposition specific though that he's like maybe we just have to do this against Man City this week because they're that good yeah I mean although saying that we've seen it we've seen it in the past first games for City I mean this this season in particular where you know they're not full strength they're not fully up to speed this could have been a this could have been an opportunity and I'm not comparing things from previous Seasons so much but know Spurs beaten one nil on the start first game of the season a couple of years ago with Nuno espiro Santo as the manager like it's it was definitely there's definitely opportunity when you're missing when you're missing some of your best players he scared me he really was like oh oh I I don't think I like you I don't think I like you Mesa I just I just got that immediate icky feeling of I don't like this um but it's one game you know I don't have have much more r view of it but it's one game and it's against you know one of the best teams in the world um but yeah I think you have to make unless you hear something but maybe won't hear it all predicted lineup I I don't think I saw many predicted lineups that didn't have Sterling starting this week because I was really surprised about it I was looking at it for like a draft league and trying to work for because I had Bob in one of my in a draft League I was playing I was like I need to find a replacement and I was like what yeah a lot of people think Sterling's going to start didn't didn't expect this um not even in the squad and then not in the squad so I'm like am I going to hear if munu is not playing next week not sure I will um but I think yeah I think I think I probably do however if Lester are terrible tomorrow night everyone's going to do inung Smith row everyone's going to do it like they G like it's oh I can have a million Quin in the bank and I don't get the price drops and then as soon as a few people start doing it and you see that 6.5 can go to 6.4 you're going to be like has anyone has anyone done it yet yet I haven't even had a look whether anyone's done it just yet because you know you know what people are like it's not doesn't it doesn't necessarily have to be you know the 500 people 460 people that are watching us or whoever that watching that makes these price changes happen right the big the hug pal has been sold by 4 2 and a half thousand people already yeah Inu 21k the best thing that will happen this week the gift of FPL this week is that the first player to drop this season will be hly Watkins that yes because he was 35% owned yeah yeah yeah and everyone's just gone NOP so we're all going to we're all going to be able to get an 8.9 like he going to go and play Lester and Everton in three and four and he's going to be 8.9 8.8 million yeah yeah yeah like if he blanks against Arsenal he could be 8.8 Million by the time that comes around yeah that'd be amazing and because a third of the game we'll be looking at him before looking at Inu that'll make it okay yeah fair that will probably make it okay we'll probably get a fair amount of time then as I say 13% of the game we've got trippy are yeah it we will see we will definitely definitely definitely see some transfers out but like at the moment 20,000 people have brought enu in and you know why because they just looking on the fixtures and like who's got fixtures green green Green I'll have him yeah yeah this is very true yeah he's not going anywhere 20K 20K in 20K out yeah yeah so he might be he might be okay and you know I know like if you're bigger owned you've got to have bigger out because obviously your percentage doesn't change that much but harland's got IP switch this week harland's got I switch this week yeah he should be flying up in the yeah people were oh Watkins yeah I can transfer X and do this man and take that man out like like people are taking Palmer out yeah because he's 10.5 yeah and why are they taking Palmer out is because they want to use Palmer and Watkins to get Harland yeah so they'll do Smith row and Harland for Watkins and Palmer those things will happen love this game I love this game yeah I love this game so I think I think we'll get away with it for a week no um but that's a really interesting decision here let me ask you again again you don't own so you're impartial if you had unu and you had Gabrielle on your bench would you start Gabrielle over and kungu this week uh yeah away at Villa or kungu at home to walls but hey who knows I mean it depends I guess it depends on away towards they yeah depends on like the why Jackson came off because I say I'm I'm neutral but I'm also like have a significant lack of information so if Jackson looks like he could be out I would probably play in kungu over Gabrielle if if I'm going in blind I'll probably start Gabrielle over in kungu I think he that's the choice I mean surely there's a better option than that surely I just want to start Gabrielle and inku if I can I will that would be my ideal scenario would be to be to do that good good good defenses keep clean sheets occasionally they don't keep clean sheets but again you know they're good from set pieces so I don't thinku would have been expecting to a come off and that you could also see that reaction because he was quite unselfish like he he's he's he's just a good player you can see on the ball he's a very very good player so would I be surprised if he was um a lot lot more selfish no I wouldn't be surprised but hey by this time next week they could have J Felix in and he's stying I saw someone talking about saw someone in a WhatsApp group today just while just before we started talking about osaman as well like like they need like they need some more players Chelsea oh yeah we haven't we haven't we've have we even spoken about the fact that they they squad list is like 48 players not our concern mate well we do talk about a lot of things that aren't our concern but yeah there we go um I think that's us done mate I think we're good uh it's now 11 oh cool mate I've only got another 45 minutes of sorting stuff out to until so we can get a podcast out and then we'll and then we'll be all good but I'm so glad I'm back actually so the last week you know trying to snip together videos and try and put stuff out last week was a pain but we'll try and uh we'll try and we'll try and resolve that at some point at some Point I've got to go away though this week I'm it's my tri turn for a trip trip to the In-laws during the week this week so yeah we'll have to we'll have to talk about Thursday when you whether you're free by Thursday um but if not we'll find I need have a look at that yeah we'll if not if not we'll find out we'll find uh we'll find someone to to step in um that's no problem we'll find some time we'll find some time man sounds good sounds good thank you again to everyone that's joined us in the chat there's been over 500 viewing here at one point um good banter at the start and uh yeah it's all it's all good and we're only like 15 people away from 15 Subs away from 8K now so if you are here and you haven't done so already please do drop a like on the video if you've enjoyed the content today and if you want to see more of it drop a subscribe we'll be back on Thursday with our team selection for game week two I very much think it'll be more about rotating players around rather than transfers but we will talk about the uh the week coming up we'll have more information and I'll go and watch some of the games so that I actually have at least I can at least actually talk about it properly um it's obviously been a bit difficult this weekend but uh but we make it work we make it work mate we make it work and look I've seen loads and loads of familiar faces in the chat and stuff and um because we had to get through it we haven't chat as much as we would do normally normally on Sunday we'll try and chat with you guys a bit more um but um it's been really pleasing to see a lot of people back you know what I mean every summer you're like oh we're doing this again oh yeah we're doing this again um but uh uh if you like it if you think other people should like it

laughing is take two take this is take two what we recorded 10 hours ago yeah you went out and played golf so and as anybody watches this pod knows we're completely relying on you to do anything so uh so we didn't get the Pod straight out um and I've made at least half doesn't change is based just off the fact of Oscar Bob getting injured perfect I mean do you think that meant that my team wasn't flexible enough in the first place well it probably wasn't I mean and and I think that's what you said earlier as well you were like it was a team of like if it goes well this is great but if something goes wrong then you know could require surgery which is exactly what's happened so we're here again it's our gameweek one team selections and we're going to go through it all over again so we've got the robt graphic we've got talk about FES we've got our teams and we are now less than at time of recording two days away from the deadline which is which is mad and and stuff still can change right stuff still can change between now and and obviously then you know we had the whole Gabrielle um celba drama last year which we were even joking about earlier on the golf course all sorts of things can happen and um and things will happen in these next two days they will happen once people start managers start talking we'll probably get our first pressers tomorrow oh god well we're going to we're going to get the Friday night presser certainly yeah definitely yeah it's all going to it's all going to start this is where the fun begins you look forward to this bit don't you for getting going I do I do I just want to get moving I just want to get I just want to get the ball rolling once it's locked in there's less that I can do and even in the preseason I we talked about Tinkers and I've done like five maybe six different drafts over the period of the whole preseason since the game launched like and again we see we see screenshots of people's photo albums with 50 or 60 and that's just from the last like four days or whatever they've done and that's just not me so I don't need all of that indecision I don't mind I don't mind messing around near the deadline I don't mind that that's that bits fun as well like if stuff changes in the by the deadline that's fun for me um I guess it probably I probably need to make it less fun or at least be or at least or at least be better prepared for it but because of the way that I played the game in the past I mean for me just to go oh no he's out okay cool I can do XY Z and just do it rather than actually you know sense checking making sure it's a reasonable uh plan and making sure it doesn't trap me out of stuff for future weeks I mean in the past I've never really looked at that and I'm you know being somewhere like Fest on Friday I'm not going to get the chance to to relook at certain things so we need to I need to really have two or three different options I'm jealous of it though because I mean that's you know we set up the whole of E some of the reasons we did this podcast was that we do things very very differently and and even the way we do what we do in this is the reason why you put the Pod together is because you're the doe I'm like let ever think about this and I I hate it when it starts going I love it when it's not moving and I'm got to see ranks and moving stuff around and thinking how things might change I'm like let's just stay in this moment so I dread Friday coming along ah M we'll have a couple of fireballs we'll be fine we will be fine we'll be fine um so for everyone if you are coming to Fantasy Football Fest we will be there um I'll be there from sort of early afternoon and Baker's gonna join midaf afternoon early evening type Vibes yeah we'll make it all the way to the end I'm sure we will and our boy crypto block Dan and crypto block Dan so yeah thanks again to Dan as always for supporting the podcast um really appreciate it and you can come and meet Dan on Friday as well so yeah shout out to you Dan thank you very much if you are watching on YouTube uh please do drop a like like on the video if you enjoy the content and please do hit subscribe we are close to 8,000 followers 8,000 followers 8,000 Subs on uh on YouTube so you know let's get we could get there with this video Let's Get There Before the deadline that would be absolutely amazing and uh if you are listening on Spotify Apple Etc I mean drop a little five star rating drop a review on there and that'll be absolutely fantastic so let's move on to the fixtures because we don't have much time now we have 10 hours left than we did earlier so we probably should start talking about the fixtures and so what we're going to bring up now is we're going to bring up the wonderful uh graphic from Rob T so Rob T's back giving us the the details from um it's basically the betting odds uh it's a compilation of like the betting odds and stuff from spreadex and what it's going to show is for anyone that's new is the expected goals uh for conceded and percentage chance of clean sheet for each team so there's obviously a few clear um uh clear ones in in in this week when you look at the the teams that we are you know targeting that's that's quite obvious so the teams with over two goals expected or two and above are Manchester United who have 2.25 Arsenal 2.65 Newcastle 2.6 uh City have two Liverpool 2.55 and then Spurs 2.2 but Arsenal are clearing away the most likely um according to the odds to keep a clean sheet at over 52% chance of a clean sheet which is really only team really likely to keep a clean sheet isn't it well yeah more than more than more than 50% yeah literally we like we like 40% is or above when we're looking at this so for anyone new to these Graphics what we are looking at each week is all 40% teams realistically all the other teams have got basically about two two3 chance that won't cling or worse you know is it's um it is big and I think um this is one of those that I've wrestled with actually since we CH chat this morning about this fixture is straight in front of you um Villa's bad fixture for for cleans but they conceded 16 goals from set pieces last season that's more than Tottenham how much did we talk about Tottenham and set pieces last season loads and we've even spoken about we've even spoken about set pieces and Arsenal's attacking threat preseason with or you did with Ted with Ted kson so we've seen it we've seen it I saw a really good thread out earlier um I'll retweet that later but just on the tactics they employed just in them in the Leon game and it was it was pretty cool it was pretty cool some of the stuff they did um they're still doing all the stuff of mess with the keepers they're still doing all the things they do they're still doing the weird runs like just added height as well I mean calor's come in um basically a foot taller than than zenchenko and they've just added height across the board I mean I I was talking to someone about this the other day just just how tall these guys are I mean Gabrielle's big cela's Big Ben White's pretty big you know califur is big ht's big rice big um these are all tall guys yes it it it just makes things so difficult to to Mark the right multiple Target again that part that test they have multip it it is interesting that for people with two premium Defenders I think most people I've seen now have moved around to vardia or Trent like you there's hardly any drafts that are CBA and Gabrielle yeah we just saw them both we just saw them both get on the on the score sheet and clean like like imagine that that you have that early on and it it is it is tempting in I think one of the things that's happened today with the Bob injury is he was gold for wild car 4 you know when I yeah yeah one of the reasons I was really happy to take a risk on him was that I was quite open to W card 4 um you know it's a there's some really clear things like Liverpool Chelsea gets better Villa get better etc etc um and and then these first three you could really go heavy on Arsenal well Bob out all of it becomes a lot more expensive like it's it's it's not as easy to do any of these things um but yeah I think it's hard to look at that and think that if some people have got CRA and gabri and we had this drama last year of get who's the right one and one didn't play it could be the drama this week of get who do you get right because ca's 40% own in the game yeah that's scary is it but from our BPS staff I'm I'm looking at Gabrielle over C about you yeah I've Gabrielle at the moment as well yeah yeah Gabrielle I mean how how difficult I mean we talk about defense I mean 2.65 expected goals this week I mean that's that's a pretty heavy attack right it's the best attack out there and we're talking about double Arsenal defense so um FR of the par black wolf I saw his uh predicted 11 for Wars have you seen that no I'll read it to you because I'd rather rather for the YouTube people they get to see the reaction or hear the reaction of uh of the team that he's put down his predicted 11 uh his predicted 11 Center back pairing is poty um mosquera who yeah uh eight new left back okay not good defensively no no but expected thought we wouldn't say this on the PO again but Matt Matt do right back lamino and Gomez that's good at least that's fine and then a front four of Gomez hang strand Larson and Sarabia yeah it's it feels open it feels feels like they can't defend and I actually said this earlier funnny enough you know they they've added no one and they've lost Netto and kilman they just weirdly they could be one of the teams that there's always a team that you feel that you that might drop in amongst those promoted sides that might get involved in that relegation battle I mean the problem is Gary O'Neil's actually pretty good right so contract pretty job yeah yeah so he's going to do a good job with the team as good as he can can he do a good enough job with that Squad of players I don't know let me say this is game week one um but having no Arsenal attack you know just feels like who is the center back pairing again potty who played quite a bit of left back when was out and mosera who apparently has of played his way into the team last good for him but uh how do you not have how do you not have key attackers from from Arsenal here like feels like good feels good for htz feels good for sacka feels good for odard yeah so this this fix is good for about six players basically from Arsenal you include ryer as well because obviously ry's been around as a as a you know as an option for for people as well in teams yeah I do think the fact that you can get S of a half a million more I I'd probably try and find it yeah no that's fair I'd probably try and find it just just those set pieces and stuff you do think you still think on R is still six points don't you you still think it's a six yeah yeah yeah yeah um and yeah yeah it is and to be honest just because of the volume of shots just because the volume of shots aren't there more than anything I think with most Keepers you're looking for you're looking obviously you're trying to look for a combination of cleans plus saves I think bonus for me I think is pretty much mudded completely for for Keepers used to find a way so sometimes some can and I think the teams where you do have people that play around a lot at the back Pope you know I watched some of the preseason of of Newcastle and he's back he's doing his ball play and he's little sweeping so he gets his passes so I do think Pope and Becker Alis Becker are comfortably the stand out you know called Becca you know what who did I watch it the other day and someone called him Becca and I've it's just slipped into my language but I had the same thing I was like why did he just call him Becca someone did that the program somewhere yeah yeah yeah but yeah obviously subliminally got in there cuz I just said it myself but freaks out a Becker who are you yeah so as uh let's let's move on to a Becker and and Company um Liverpool 2.55 here expected uh expected goals 38% chance of a clean sheet feels okay for Trent um but obviously that's a lot of money and you are looking for attacking returns you know I've had a thought about this over the over the day actually um because I'm I'm looking at Trent as uh you know is he going to be the guy that gets attacking returns possibly but then I also look across that Liverpool front fire and this is again something we were talking about earlier and I need to stop mentioning that but they've got so many attacking threats attacking options there's so many players that can get points from Liverpool right there's so many so whether it's G whether it's Diaz and Salah and it's soas now and Darwin's in there jotter obviously so when does Trent get the points right when when does Trent get the points this is it for me and I know J scores from a set piece but those don't often go to J they're more likely to go to van djk and then you yeah bonus goes away because van dijk gets the goal I just don't know and I'm I'm wonder it can be anyone didn't it it can be anyone it can be anyone but I do think like he's the best deliverer of the ball really and and so do I think that Trent will always have the returns no because I think it's very we just saw them score four and Salah wasn't involved like that that is possible for any Liverpool asset yeah and the other the problem bit with the attacking ones and potentially even Trent ones if the game's not going as well as expected they can just take you off like Bradley's right there um now that might lock in your clean for Trent but nobody nobody really wants to spend 7 million on Trent just to have a locked in clean no you're not really going to celebrate it if it walked away and it was six points and six points only because you just get because people because people with Quanza would just be there sitting there with two and a half million extra money that they've spent on a yeah yeah I don't know whoever kdb rather than an a for example exactly you're not going to be upset about it but it's not something you want to see happen I don't think anyone should try and make it that it's it's a good thing to happen it is possible for any Liverpool attacker where we see rotation and we don't even know it might still be possible with Mo that we see that kind of rotation we don't know yeah um but we do know I think you know I looked at um 11 of five's model and there he's got them expected over two for the first first five games you're like it's pretty good I'm not sure to completely ignore it um if you get it right it's great it's not necessarily Talon Manic and it's really interesting to look at someone like for example very similar prices jotter limited minutes and anybody can score but really highly functional and then you look at e he's on here you know palis expected to score 1.4 goals 22% chance of a clean most of us you know most people have got Henderson and a in their team like like really I istically it probably isn't going to work out potentially but then you ask yourself well if they do score more than one goal let's just say it does become two goals chances of him having no returns out of two goals they score yeah it feels fairly low feels fairly low you know I looked again I said 115 model he had expect they have expected goals of like eight in the first five games so you're going to be looking into this 1.4 1.5 1.6 most games it's probably reaches two when they play Palace and going uh Leicester in game four um but other than that like it's going to be around the one and a half most week so 16 16 available returns if you think a is not going to get a chunk of that yeah he's gonna be gonna have his hands on something yeah yeah and and the good part is because there's not that many that will return he has a good chance for bonus too yeah because he'll do enough stuff with it so I get it on E I get why people would look at him him say over J I also J's fun yeah J's fun J's fun and you know you say could be frustrating yeah but if he but if he scores like his his chances his minutes just go up right in theory you know he's if he's the guy scoring the goals then slot's going to want to keep that momentum going and it's going to be up to the other players in the squad to to well Darwin basically to OU him somehow and that'll be through cameos and training right I guess um but as you said if J doesn't score then you know he's he's replaceable and that's the thing like gpo's there he can play nine Darwin's there obviously he can play nine I know I'm I'm swerving the whole Liverpool attack for at the moment for not for well I guess for this reason for the first three game weeks at least because I want to see what it looks like um and I'm quite happy to miss out on those points while I'm picking up points elsewhere where people aren't right so that's at least what I'm I'm hoping will happen yeah but it's not like you're I mean we're going to show teams in a sec it's not like you're picking them from Bad teams picking good and you're you're picking better minutes players than if you look at my team they're a bit more flaky in some of the minutes um you know when we look at some of the others for this week Man United at 2.25 goals it doesn't stand out for MERS at 1.18 that doesn't Stand Out particularly well doesn't stand out to play you know I've looked at Anthony Robinson and playing him and I'm like that doesn't look really great idea yeah um does stand out for Bruno especially if he ends up he could end up playing nine again that could easily happen um I think there's some rumors maybe about Garo not being quite fit but I'm sure that will come out tomorrow if not um so that's interesting Newcastle attack looks great I mean isak's the obvious obvious pick I think that's fair um I still think the the rest of the attack you know is a is still a minutes question definitely because Gordon sure he came in um I misspoken the last pod and said that he wasn't at preseason but there he was he'd scored a goal already before I'd even said that and so he's there he's whether he's ready ready I don't know but you know whe when it's Southampton he could be rested right or or could be bled in I think limited minutes is probably a lot more likely than rested I think that's what I me that's what I was getting to that point when I I just mean doesn't start is what I mean oh he'll start so he'll start okay he'll start we we can take a big bet on that on Sunday if Sunday if you wish but but I don't see a world in which he doesn't start but does he need to play 90 minutes kind of depends on what happens in Newcastle versus Southampton if they they if they go out and are free 40 up like they've got free Wingers that are likely to play in this game in Murphy Barnes and Gordon they're going to play some part in this game the question is does Murphy come off Gordon go right and Barnes stay on or does Barnes just go straight on for for for Gordon yeah I think that's you know that that is the dicey part of any of this but he had a half any house there some good things about like this is the plans now got to ramp up for this week play something for 45 minutes to ramp up for this week and go oh okay now you're only going to play 30 minutes like not not when they haven't got the Europe to worry about have they they you know is I don't see I don't see the world in which he's not starting but there is a world in which he comes off now the most obvious World in which he comes off is they've already scored three goals and the question is if he's already been involved in those three goals then it's fine yeah of course and he's great at home he's great at home as well so that works all all I suppose that all sort of leans in his favor okay yeah yeah but it's not I don't think it's brilliant after that I don't think it's I don't think it's like everyone's like opening for is great and we'll say you obviously Tottenham is is it's been fantastic for them but but but I also say it's not it's not like a great fixture is it I don't hate it I mean I I wouldn't say it's a good fixture for Defenders across either side I think it's a good fixture for attackers both ways yeah I think it's a good fix for attackers both there is a world in which Toton go out there and beat them 2-0 and there is a world where they win 5 nil yes that that those could both happen well not all those things can happen you know I'm sort of looking at those ones and that that fixed you in G three and thinking I'll just play where I got I think in it because I do think the variables are pretty big now that might mean that I walk away with very very little but yeah or only one side of the dice to it but but um yeah I don't think and then then the other three games in the first five are away yeah difficult any other notable ones here we haven't mentioned Spurs yet but I think we're both pretty comfortable with um with the salanki porro start for both of us yeah yeah yeah I think that's yeah yeah never getting away from that no the keys to listen tomorrow about if you get any kind of news around Rison because he's been around the squad for weeks he went on tour didn't play a minute but we're told he's training but didn't play a minute he then comes back salanki doesn't sign in time or isn't ready in time to play the last friendly he plays no minutes in that ralison does not play it was also a couple of days before Destiny he in the press conference he said that both Destiny and richardon were back in full training so yeah I guess it's like is he around because you know he's he could that could limit not limit that could reduce sank minutes I guess it could do we've heard that charison almost doesn't want to go to Saudi but I think the club do want him to go to S um and what would you do if you were the club that didn't want him wanted him to go somewhere else but you wouldn't play him in game week one yeah exactly um so yeah it'd be very interesting to see if we get any any words on Mich charison from that's what you're listening for um I'm assuming we will get a press conference on for Monday night on Friday maybe I yeah I guess so I guess so I mean they're not doing anything else to these guys are they they should all even then will you get a good pref conference when it's Friday for a Monday game probably not and then you know we're not going to get we're not going to get any embargoed stuff I don't think for any of the deadline actually maybe only for the Man United versus Fulham game that's a good point uh so you know there's very limited stuff that we might get anyway does anyone become a bigger pick from Man City what I'm thinking of is toku Kish lots of chat about Bernardo Bernardo yeah yeah but I feel I guess in the same in the same breath like Bob was always going to be a sort of a makeshift to make things work and was is going to be you know an early transfer outout at some point right he was you know you said earlier like this is this was a wild card four play so come game week four he was not in the squad so if you looking at unless he wasn't and that that's the punt isn't it because if he came in and scored in game week one and he scored in game week two well he's still going to be an option in game week three and he's still option in game week four like these these things do happen like his his players just hit the ground running and they just keep playing um so he was only going to drop pal and not be an option if he was not very good like and now that position's open and yeah I think Dau and greish will probably be the the opening Wingers this weekend would do you say move Doo on the right Gish on the left you don't think he'll start you don't think he'll just start Bernardo on the right and then play greish on the left he could do he could but then I guess what does he do what does he do with kdb obviously start we don't even know if Rod's fit it's just we're getting nothing from Pep as well we're getting nothing from him in the Press yeah um Okay cool so we've covered pretty much most of it uh the only other I guess a little little surprising thing here just to just to note um Is that West Ham's West Ham have slightly better chance scoring more goals than than villa which was something a little bit surprising and obviously like the home thing plays into it here but I just definitely didn't expect to see that uh from from from that fixture which was just interesting yeah it's got It's got sort of two all over is it I mean it looks it looks again a good fixture for the attackers but um what's Dam done good business and while they're all fair this is true age probi I was quite old something of them but um while they all fit I think they're going to challenge a lot of teams I don't think they're an easy fixure anymore yeah yeah I think um is it Palace got is it palisa got West in game week two yeah uh yes yeah at Sal Park if you think that Palace have had a f season or a summer where the main stories of people leaving or potentially about to leave yeah West Ham's summer is literally all been bye bye bye bye bye bye bye by by yeah like it's it's down on like fixture ticket as being a good fixture I'm I'm not sure it's a great fixture anymore fair enough um then moving on to teams let's move on to teams let's get those done uh and let's get out of here because people are going to want to see this and the longer we talk the less time there is until the deadline so I know this will be probably Thursday morning when you listen to this or watch this uh but yeah not long to go so let's let's get through some teams um see where we are oh hold on penalties go on talk to me about penalties you know I love penalties you know I cannot do enough but talk about penalties but Henry Winter released something today and the one thing there a couple of things that we always look at in preseason one is like who were the refs that gave loads of penalties last season and anti Taylor is always the ref that gives all the penalties um and then the second bit is um is there any of these like so refs go around all the clubs and give them like a briefing and say hey this is how it's going to work this season and there hasn't been any news about it and if we' have gone with the prob done this morning we wouldn't have had the news but some news came out this afternoon this is important players told Premier League there were too many hand balls last season players have now been advised by the Premier League that not every Touch of a player's hand arm with the ball is an offense and they are not expected to move with their arms behind their back or by the side Henry Winter's words like Pogo and Penguins we shouldn't see the weird run where people run at people with their hands behind their back Hallelujah good thank for that but the fact that they've almost made that point out then immediately makes it harder to say everything else is unnatural CU they tried to claim when was running with the hands behind the back was natural um so let me just uh explain their words are the handle law is simplified now let me read the sentence no handall if justifiable position or action a clear change of trajectory when touched by or deflected from the same player played by a teammate or hits the supporting arm when a player fails or proximity simple I think the thing is you're going to see is it's going to become yeah more difficult to see that handballs are given because they also said I released a Sixpoint VAR Improvement plan and number one is maintain the high threshold for intervention intervention aim for minimum interference maximum benefit referees call like umpires call in cricket will stand unless in the opinion of the VAR based on the evidence readily available that call is a clear and obvious error so we're back there we're back we're gone full circle which we just basically saying there's no B that's yeah it does it does sound that like that semi-automated offside and then they don't get involved what are they actually doing at stockley Park I I it's it's only Pizza memes coming back but it's only it's only I guess when the referee misses something in in in the sense that they don't see it right and I guess they're just trying to improve I guess that's all we really want actually is we just want to improve the referee field of vision it's literally that and so if the referee can turn around and say if I saw it from this if I saw it then I would have given it then that's where V Should interfere and say change the decision I don't mind that I'm quite happy the high bar thing means I think we need to just stop just shouting for V when stuff happens like people are going to continue to shout for V but you almost have to just stop shouting for it because it's pointless let me read point three H improve The Fan Experience referees to announce far decisions in stadia replays and messaging to be shown on big screens with Clips or screenshot of incident but if they're not going to get involved it's never goingon to happen is it it's GNA and then they've got then they've got their own Twitter account yeah PL match Center where they'll explain what they've done that's that's a one way gonna do nothing they're gonna do nothing they're just basically not going to get involved are they just gonna sit there and take a wage take W yeah perfect beautiful so on that note how many penalty takers you got that is a great didn't didn't prep me for this question how many penalty takers have I got um one two 3 four five six maybe seven may maybe well between five and seven I would say wow maybe four and seven maybe four I've got some I've got some shaky ones in there in truth I've got some very shaky ones so okay let's move on to my team so my team's coming up on screen now and um so let's just quickly run through those maybe penalty takers maybe not and you can tell me whether I'm being uh a bit hopeful so game week one maybe a penalty taker in kungu Gibbs white maybe Gibbs white penalty taker we think so odard game we one maybe I mean it could be any game week he maybe odard and kungu could easily be for part of the game couldn't they yeah whether that be the start or whether that be the end could be both of them penalty takers part of that game Bruno Fernandez is a penalty taker okay cool xia Pedro is a penalty taker when he's on the pitch yes uh erling Holland penalty taker Dominic salanki Mitchell has taken Dominic senen Mitchell I don't think he's taking penalties no okay fair enough so maybe I've got like I've got four nailed maybe seven salanki would take the penalty if sun was off the pitch correct sun is getting older yeah exactly like part of you know bringing people in and is that that we don't have to run Sun into the ground that we've had to recently um son son's gonna be important for Europa League games if we need to actually you know bring on some Cavalry right so we need minutes out of his legs um so yeah oh yeah we can't keep using him for 3,000 minutes every season it's insane um so he probably does have 10 to 15 minutes out of out quite on the average game salanki so between anunu odard and salanki you probably do get a few extra penalties the season maybe so let's read it out so that everyone knows um what we're doing so I've got Allison Becker a Becker in goal and then I've got Gabrielle Trent and porro so pretty big Hefty at the back that's big really really big and then Midfield in kungu Gibs white odard and Bruno and Bruno has my captain Z band at the moment because it's fun it's Fest and I'm going to be top 100 in the world on Friday night and then and then well he's the only player so I won't be but and then jaia Pedro Harland salanki um and then 4.0 keeper 4.0 Defender and then Robinson and Smith row basically so those two guys are there really to cover game week three this has a sort of a wild card six in mind but given that I've got two um two Liverpool and two Arsenal means I can dance around game weeks four and game weeks six if I need to and I can you know I can extend that depending on how the how things are happening right um not just necessarily how they're playing but also how others sort of fit in so you know we may find the when Palmer gets bully back into it that Inu becomes a complete waste of space we don't know um when zaka come well I mean we we know we know what to get with the other ones but andu is the one really is is is the one I'm thinking but the problem is is there's no one there's no one at that price point and below that unless I've see I can see what's happening with them I'd want to pick them so I'm immediately thinking like Morgan Rogers I'm thinking yanku Mina um you know Smith row feels good because of the I switch game I think think it's a really good uh game there obviously preseason he comes in he gets minutes straight away he scores goals it's like it's like an immediate like I'm starting in the Premier League this is how I'm going to uh how I'm going to go so by gameweek three like as far as I'm concerned he'll be fully in and and and doing what he does so it's a great fixture for him um the rest the rest of those prices I I I just want to see yeah I just hope that someone hope someone sort of steps up and sticks out a little bit that just allows a bit more flexibility in the budget elsewhere I'm not 100% on this again you know we just had the discussion about the Liverpool defense so you know that could that could uh that could change things in well in terms of like Trent's involvement so could K Quanza cover Trent potentially because even if they are expected to have I don't know how many it would be maybe like 12 13 14 goals in the first five games it could you know those returns get spread across Salah jot Diaz Etc how many of those comes to Trent and if it's really the clean sheet if I'm only covering the clean sheet and I maybe miss out on one return or two returns like the value of that two and a half million extra into the rest of my squad could be worth more than than six points yeah I need to value that I've played with Quant quite a bit I've put him in I've put him in and take him out many times now I really I think because I think he's exceptional value but one is he takes a Liverpool spot and you're already taking a li spot with with Allison yeah so if you take him it's like well the only way I now do it is if I upgrade him to Trent so it's really weird one to use a transfer for and if you wanted if you end up wanting Trent in then it gets odd and if you did to go him in plus having Quanza andison then you got not get any attack in and at some point you're going to get that attack in um yeah true second point is is that it's not like canate is not going to play at all he's going to play some games and it's not probably like canate is going to play his first game of the season in Champions League yeah got this his first game they I think it might get rotated a little bit and because there's some really really good assets I'm like I don't I don't want my fringes to be that risky you know the 4.5s and the likes I kind of want to go look at them and think I really like them or or or I want to know they're going to play when I really want them to play so like in game week two like this these back lines great but in game week two you've got obviously the situation where Robinson's got Leicester which is a fantastic picture yeah but Quan's got brenford pretty good yeah you'd still want Robinson in that in that situation still would you know I still think it's that that I think we're going to come mind is a pretty similar defense but do I really want to bring Robinson in say for example for Gabrielle in game week two and getting foror and gameing fre I'm not 100% convinced of that I really am not you know I think when I think when we look at it it's um they're elite players that's why they cost so much money difficult but what you've got with Robinson is a really good option that even if you even if something happened like an injury to any of your players you are I could just play him any week yeah that's why he's that's why he's really good Smith by the way um uh there was a thing from on the fullon website today where um Marcus Hill said he hasn't played games consistently so it's going to be a process for him to be in his best physical condition but we've already seen that he can make an impact he can make a difference two guys in two games is a good star so in a way I'll be like I don't really like him game week one but game week two hopefully how long does it take you know what I mean and do those pieces of it but I guess that the if you're not in the best physical condition and you're injury prone there's still that risk that you could get injured again yeah that's always that's always the that's always the worry with it yeah well we got some similarities but let's let's move on to let's move on to your team um and yeah just talk us talk us through it for those list in audio yeah um so I've currently got uh Henderson in goal I've had Henderson in goal most of the season um I think one positive today sounded like on gay sounds like they suddenly had asking for astronomical bits of money um I do think again the Bob transfer feels to me like that could accelerate as to Man City that's scary for me on the on on uh on NSA pick um but uh and scary for me a bit on Palace pick but Henderson I still like out of 4.5 so he's in parro and Gabrielle um Gabrielle over vardal at the moment feel more comfortable on that I also think like grish Gish minutes get a bit bumped today with a bob out yeah and the more games that greish plays the kind of less I like v um so I'm a little bit more comfortable in that I've currently got Hall in starting I like his first two games um realistically I just W him this week after that I'm quite happy to play play Robinson on my bench if I needed to and I I would as I said I not I don't have a lot of worries about not playing p and Gabrielle in and their wor of fixtures but um like to play a lot I've seen our friend TT did a really good Fred about him uh as he did about Gordon so Gordon's come in for me today um he's been in and around my drafts but I haven't been sure really on it but I like Gordon more than I like a at the moment uh so he's in with Saka with anunu and dieo jot is my other midfielder and then my big three up front is sank EAC and harand year bench Anthony Barco and Winks there's not a lot there so you still you still looking at early wild card no I don't so no I don't so with that team I'd be very surprised if it's I'd be very surprised if that would be a game week four wild card um if it was I'd probably try and dial it up a little bit on a few a few other players I want to check some fixtures I'll probably if I was getting we four wild card in I would probably look I'd probably look at CA over Hall and I'd probably look to try and get maybe Pope and goal um and it would be someone like andu back down to Smith row I think that's a you know it sounds mad but I think Smith row over the first three versus and kungu is a very good bargain yeah qu quite tell that about yeah because I mean I say Chelsea are going to need Inu to start the first game but then players coming back second game third game Anything Can Happen yeah or I'd be like you and and I like I like Gibbs white I like andu for the open yeah well them Forest first three are better than better than most to be honest if you're looking at short-term Horizons I mean if you were still wild card in gameweek four like we just would you have picked the forest 4 five over Henderson if we just knew who it was I hate Matt Sals I just think he's terrible I just think I just think he's terrible that's the problem if if the four five was was big six8 mguel despite the fact that I've never seen him then I probably would um but yeah I just can't I just can't back him what I might do if I was definitely wild card in game four is go AA over Hall um so I like Williams better than I like AA but there's a few links with Williams away from the club um and so I'd probably go AA as as as um an option it's something still I'm considering as a 4.5 um albeit I look at it and say right in game week one I like Hall more I like AA and then in game weeks two and three I like Robinson more than I like AA and then I'm like yeah what's the point what's the point yeah that's fair what's the point um so yeah as always on my mind you know as a and Rogers could be Gordon and Winks um but I'd probably need something really sort of concrete on essay that it's it's going to be okay that he's definitely staying some kind of commitment on that um saying that like Gordon's not nailed to stay either no no does it worry you does it worry that there's little are you using two I guess it's to of two questions are you you worried about not having enough having any Villa as they sort of start that gameweek three set of fixtures are you using esack as the makeway to Watkins for example is I guess what I'm kind of asking because I don't want to talk about gameweek three but the gameweek one team like the gameweek one team defines how you're going to approach these games right so it is important yeah yeah I I don't think I have a Palmer or Watkins definite plan yeah I'm still more focused on to Liverpool more than anything else fair enough um but my Watkins there is a Watkins plan which is that I can afford Harland I could afford to go Harland to Watkins is you five six million six million yeah gives you six million quid um which you know gives me the money to move uh Gabriel a parro up to Trent yeah and then gives me money to then look at even sacka for example to seller so that it could be an easy one Gabrielle sacka and and um and harand to Watkins Trenton Mo you could even get Gordon there couldn't you probably could harand down 6 million 6 million on top of Gordon is 13 and a half so you only need 12 and a half for Salah and then Gabrielle up to is a million a million so you can just do those three although although you you know two weeks later You're Gonna Want Arsenal back that's all all dependent on you know everyone stays at the same values and all those ones and it well of course yeah exactly hoping that your players have done well enough that they haven't dropped in value and done better than the ones that you didn't pick so therefore they' have not gained in value um but yeah it would enable you know Gordon or jotter potentially to sell so if for example J's not the pick and s's the pick then I've got that way out but yeah I think realistically the only way in my team that I get to Watkins is through Harland because salanki and esack so expensive yeah fair enough um the other things you can do obviously is like isack to J Pedro and then that enables sacka to Salah that's there even that move esack to J Pedro sacka to Salah and then still some money around to to play with so there's definitely you know options in which you can move stuff um but also if you've got the transfer saved you might just say I'm going to Wild Card it and then keep my transfers yeah yeah yeah God oh it's really hard to work out how that's actually physically going to play out on your head is it the transfer still yeah just wondering whether yeah and whether we should be building these transfers up early and just trying to basically keep a float basically for problems or whether it's a case of maybe maybe the better move might be to just use a couple of transfers here and there and just to you know keep it ticking over you know improving as things change as new information comes in I guess we will find that out um how set are you on your team because I think I'm probably about I'd probably say like 85% so I'm not 100% there yet and changes will be made on Friday maybe yeah I suspect I suspect there's two to three positions the two other Newcastle players in Gordon and Hall um and probably then whether it means I could get Winks Rogers if I went up to it and then have a better eight attacker yeah yeah I mean I like everything pretty much apart from Inu to be honest it's weird in it it's like the team it's a fixture as well yeah the open VI Is Not Great says Man City on the screen fantastic is it like the Man City on the screen just goes in my head I'm just like uh am I should I be doing this surely there's a better option than this it's a 38 game we season but you can't have every every fixture perfect I know um but we can try is is I just think andu is incredible value for money and looks fantastic everything we've seen of him there's been nothing I've seen from him from preseason that makes me particularly worried about minutes as in and when I mean minutes I mean his injury minutes more than anything else is is um whether there's a minute's risk because they've got 177,000 players well that's that's different but I still look at the all of their squad and think he's their best one yeah really obviously Palmer is Palmer which still really worked out where Palmer's going to be in this position have we like where is he going to be on the pitch yeah because he play he play he plays off the right but that's 10 yeah but that's almost where you'd expect you might even expect Inu to sit in that I think maybe more towards a left 10 or does he go nine but they're talking about Nico they're giving contracts so Co pal sign new contract now Nico Jackson they're going straight for a new cont why would they go why they trying to sign 12 forwards right and also still give Nico a brand new contract SP he signing last summer no none of it makes any sense no this is going to it's going to unravel in a big uh it's going to unravel at some point in the next couple of years and it's just going to be absolute chaos it will unless it doesn't because like it's almost so chaotic that you start to think to yourself are they the future yeah they actually just worked out how to play the game yeah like Palmer's contract is like until 2033 it's a n-year contract like he's literally he's now set until he's basically until he's 28 and these are the this is the team that originally did this you remember they did the Winston Bogard we old enough to remember they sign Winston Bogard and he played like four games and then sat on like 70 grand a week for five six years yeah never Lear oh yeah yeah new new new stewardship same same issues same Madness same issues cool um right so as we've said we will be at Fantasy Football first on Friday hopefully you can come and join us if you do come and say hello and um yeah we'll be happy to have a chat have a drink whatever and how how many coasters are you taking to Fest 500 I need you to order some more coasters by the way sorry let me just clarify that how many coasters we taking the 500 I got a box I got a box I'm just going to stick on the bar I heard a radio update said there's 400 people there yeah yeah it's one each at least one each yeah yeah so people can use them they can steal them they can do whatever they like um yeah I I have saved a few for when I get back so that we can give some away so if you aren't at Fest don't worry they still we going to be some more and then in about a week's time I'm going to send Baker a message saying Baker can you just order some more coasters please more coasters yeah and then and then we'll have more and then we'll have more it's amazing are we going to do a are we going to do a coaster flip comment ition we did that at home we got to do that again oh don't God flip the be mats oh my word we we'll yeah maybe we can do something like that maybe we can do something like that but if you haven't done so already drop a like on a video we're almost at 8,000 Subs hit subscribe and thank you for your support during preseason it's almost here game one good luck Good Luck Good Luck

23,AboveAverageFPL,Qbr40OpACus,Does Solanke Change Everything For GW1 In FPL | Fantasy Premier League Tips 24/25,2024-08-11T06:30:15Z,"less than a week to go to the gameweek 1 deadline transfer Market's hotting up preseason almost finished take a look at some more [Music] drafts right guys welcome back this is the above average FPL podcast my name's Adam and as always I'm joined by Baker evening mate how are you very well mate Saturday night you can tell it must be preseason if we're ping on a Saturday night well lots of things lots of things going on obviously I'm I'm on holiday now technically uh you can see little change of scenery going on guitars and whatnot and uh you're basically a floating head so I'm just a floating head I'm either a floating head or have insanely wide shoulders I'm one of the two for so people can guess that on the uh on the comments but yeah maybe it's just a floating head maybe it's just a floating head so at the time of recording the community Shield was played today so that's where we are um I say we got just under a week to go now until the game we one deadline and we brought another guest on because we enjoy having people to chat with uh so we've got JC FPL Spaceman JC how you doing hello yeah I'm good nice to be back nice to be on uh good to see you both yeah doing all right such a happy guy so relaxed yes I mean I've got a cold so I'm paring down the V tablets but um I'm good otherwise you're all good you're all good uh tinkering much at all at the moment or is it still you still waiting for because because I imagine you're doing a lot of uh you know you're looking at preseason for for minutes I guess more than anything yeah mostly I mean like there is some stuff in terms of like well if this guy's out then does that mean this guy's moving forward but you you're moving the needle rather than unearthing some hidden oh this guy's playing Striker we had no idea um I think the days of those are sadly behind us with so many active engage managers following it but um yeah it's good to see who's playing and who's who's fit and whether players come back from injury already whether new transfers are ready um but mostly yeah I just I kind of follow along whereas I think some people have been drafting since the since the day the game opened so I don't know how much energy they got left um I've I've tinkered a bit mostly just like see how the pieces fit together uh landscape stuff um but I play a few other formats as well so I'm getting models and stuff ready for those and seeing how they go but um yeah punch time soon that's most of the preseason done so we'll be properly tinkering this week locking everything in I can't do more than one game I try I try I do do a little bit of fan tracks draft I do a little bit Draft when it's draft because you're sort of then like allocated players almost it doesn't feel like you're having to do as much you just sort of set lineups most of the time little but I can't do it but Adam you play a couple of things so rare yes I'm playing so rare at the moment so that's good definitely JC how many games do you play um not as many as some people I know but I do FPL I'll do a couple of FPL drafts with some friends um I'm playing Telegraph and sundream team this year uh and fan team as well so there's like a multi-entry fan team once you end up managing well you can enter up to 25 but I'll do it it's like five stacks of five or something um I think I saw this year played Sky last year as well but it's nice to just play around well I do I am playing Al fensin and Elite seran as well of course you are Swedish and forgot yeah just ran a quick solve this morning for the Swedish want play wild card um but I'm not sure I know who all the players are but it's just fun do you do badly in any of them I'm not doing well in Alvin this yet um but Elite seran is my first season and seem to be top 1K all of us I don't know what I've done but um I have bad Seasons I didn't win the draft last year my friends make fun of me because I spend so much time on the games and got beat used toadly season before last 900 something 909 think I think yeah IED around there 25 26 I had a bit burst because well good fortune basically didn't have any Li attackers when they all got injured in the double game week um um then Wild Card uh and ranked about 400th I thought okay must have a crack at top 100 uh and finished like two and a half K but um fun enough not owning Harland for his four goals against wolves will drop you down the ranks but uh no regrets it was good fun yeah but you yeah I I guess do you feel like you played that way more aggressively because of the 900 of the time before and it was a how far can you go yeah I think having had that season I felt a lot Freer to kind of play around um and that season before as well I'd had some pretty good underlying data ranks as well I was first on the massive data ranking on review um which has still has plenty luck involved like I remember falling into oh I've got three man united players and their double game week was just suddenly much earlier and I was like oh I'm well set for that um which wasn't brilliant planning or great play it was possible but it went my way um so there's variation in that but I was okay now that I've come first in this and got top 1K don't you know I don't feel like I needed to prove anything if I'm still ranked highly I'll I'll Chase those and also playing other games where there's money online FPL is free game might as well I'm going to express myself anywhere with some silly pcks or some interesting paths then fpl's a place to do it I think yeah it's it's like the analytical version of my team my emotion basically it's absolutely that exactly and that's what baker said and baker said and Luke said as well that you know if there's anybody that I should be speaking to about how to improve the way that I play is to actually speak to you and um more often and get into your head and understand yeah understand how are the same coin don't we yeah basically except I play a lot with my lot more of my heart I would say than your emotion exactly exactly but that's just the way it is me I think I I play with my brain and then let my emotion follow whatever happens I like I like riding the emotional wave and just being like I've picked this team let's see what happens rather than I'm going to put my emotion into the selection yeah the decision yeah putting the emotion into the decision is probably the wrong place to be whereas the emotion coming out the outcome is fine yeah that makes more sense I can I got really angry when harand scored four goals should have done but not picking him was still that was fine it wasn't stupid well maybe it was a lot people but hey look if you could be fun you can be you know Sly picks and get the figure like that's I guess you know we're sitting here less than 1K 2K there's not many people that do that back to back so so there is Method there is Method there and we know obviously you know from us knowing you analytics World in terms of how you would work it use of models use of solvers um how long's that been that you've operated in that world in ter fantasy in terms of fantasy it's probably been three seasons I think I think it was three seasons ago it was the year after the covid year where I built my own model um whereas before that I was just playing with friends and but I think I was always of that mindset that makes sense that data is going to be useful and we should think about things probabilistically rather than binary and um I just wasn't applying it to fpl and then found other people who were and realized that there was a lot of cool things you could do so I tried my own model and then gave up on it because it was a lot of f um and there was a relatively cheap one that was much better and I didn't have to do all the maintenance um so that was three seasons ago and then the md1 season was my first season of like I'm all in on this right experimenting um so I'd say two seasons of like properly getting stuck into it and actually building my own stuff and um getting involved in Twitter and Discord circles rather than just watching YouTube videos and having a go um but yeah it's it's great it's a great group I really like it how does it play out like at the start of the season I think you know in most people's worlds there's a lot of people that say like you can't win FBA in the first few weeks but you can lose it you know and all that thing is said you know there's a lot of people says sort of stay with the pack and all that sort of things in know does any of that play out at all in your thinking I know you've I've heard you on other podcast talk about like Risk and setting setting your risk and stuff like that so I think that'd be quite interesting if you just sort of say that because there'd be lots of people this that haven't heard how you try to apply risk in your team and does it change at the start of the season yeah I think um last year was the first year where I sort of really started trying to tune the risk in as like an actual factor that was coming into it rather than just like a captain decision from before um I was actually like okay what macro strategy stuff am I going to do to try and be but still make good picks um and you do dial it up right at the end actually right at the start is maybe not the time to be doing that specifically you're not looking for it because it's got so much knock on effects so if you're you know a million down on team value towards the end of the season that can lose a bit but it's not as much as you might think and actually we have done measurements on that and you can kind of value it so maybe making an early transfer uh during game week two or something okay I'm probably going to make this move but I might make it now because I can capatch the price rise and avoid the price fall so I think early on last year it used to be to do with like protecting a bit of Team value um rather than trying to like find okay this player is someone that I think other people aren't on and I can get on them and get some relative risk there um and if you play with the objective risk which is like How likely is it that something goes wrong or how you know do the pieces fit together if this guy gets injured how badly does that go um or I'm making a bet on an unproven player so I I avoided Jackson at the start of last season because he don't had one season of of data in a top five league so he'd been at V Royale for a season and that was basically it so the error bars are much wider so I'll try and avoid that at the start but then towards the end you start dialing up the oh we've got a pretty good idea of of these guys now but I can choose this path that takes me through some players that people don't own or even just avoids a highly owned player like like harand but at the start it's trying to be robust so so that things don't don't go wrong um and often when you do that actually because because some of that thinking and some of the models aren't propagated all the way through the community then that does just lead you to a player that's a bit different um so I remember on like wild card 17 I played last year a lot of us went on Douglas Louise because he was on penalties and good for bonus and obviously we got a bit lucky when he kept scoring but that was a player that looked pretty and everyone was like maybe I should get him but it's pretty boring I don't want him my friends were like I don't want I don't want a wild card into into Douglas toise that's boring but for me that was like oh that's a player that the data suggesting is good and people don't want to put in so to me that's enticing I get excited by that like okay great I don't have to seek risk out it's coming to me easily I just put him in uh and we got lucky he did score some penalties in and that doesn't always happen but um yeah sometimes the risk just sort of comes to you without having to search it and I think that used to happen a lot more based on talking to people who were in The analytic space a bit before me actually these paths that came out was so different to what everyone else was doing that you could almost just kind of walk into that relative risk position just by playing for maximizing respected value but at the minute yeah I wouldn't look for anything too different you can also start with the template team and react differently I think that's something that happens quite a lot in the other games um because a template is actually stronger in some of the other formats that I've played um more so than it is in FPL despite the complaints that some people make um FPL there's still quite a lot of degrees of freedom um so you can just pick a template team and go okay I'm going to not make this transfer when I see everyone else doing it or just picking the Lesser traveled path of the 50-50s all of a sudden you've got Doug L in your team I mean the the risk obviously the risk with the other games is that is that there's actual money around right right there's actually something there's actually something to play for so you don't want to you don't want to lose the chance you could probably Middle with a pack and you know on a fan team 20 pound entry you could Middle with a pack and you know get a little bit of upside and you might win 24 quid right for example so you know so you can see why it's sensible to to at least let you know the people who are pissing around you know just fall away um and that's how I play other games so if I do go play them I be like fan te I'll be like I'll put 20 quid I'll do the I'll put a ridiculous team out really early on and by going week four it hasn't worked out and I'm not playing this anymore yeah which is fine people could do that yeah yeah but you're happy you're happy when people do that yeah well guess I guess so of course you are um yeah I guess that is putting into the prize pot um I think also you talk about like staying with the pack early on and I think that's much less in our control than people think it is especially right at the start because what who is the pack there's like 10 million people you don't know which people are going to be stick staying the course that's it um and even if You' stay with the pack in terms of like expected outcomes your relative outcomes are going to be really wide early on because if you're just in the bottom percentile of luck in the first five weeks you're going to be way behind some people who are in the top 10% now for 5 weeks and you expect some people to be lucky for five weeks and some people to be unlucky for five weeks so if you're ranked like 4 million after five weeks but you look at your underlying data or you go actually like I didn't really make any mistakes here I just was unfortunate then you don't necessarily have to start chasing there or going okay need to change my strategy entirely cuz people come through later on like I think it was kazer who was like three or four million after like game week eight or nine and he finished like top 10K without doing anything differently he's just like I just kept playing but there's it's hard to get your head around that and I think like it's not it's not invalid to go I'm 3 million after game week eight that's frustrating it should be it is frustrating but also if you evaluate your team and your picks and you go actually I didn't really do anything I didn't think I should have done you probably just on the wrong side of eight coin flips um so keep doing what you're doing and you'll come back and hold you hold your head don't know we should get into we got some we got we got some dfts we we need to talk about salanki we need to we need to do we need to do the admin first before we do that we need to do the admin so okay yeah if you're if you're listening on YouTube and you enjoy the content that we do please make sure you do drop a like on the video and if you want to see more from us make sure you drop a subscribe uh if you want to go follow Johnny he is atplore Spaceman onx and you can go and find him there you can find him in the analytics Discord uh there'll be a link to that in the description below as well if I can find it while I'm on holiday um I'll I'll send it over yeah cool that will work that will work and um yeah if you're listening on Spotify Apple wherever you know drop a review on there and you can drop a comment in Spotify and as long as you're not being horrific to us I can publish it um because it doesn't mean I'm just going to post all the good ones I'll post the mediocre ones as well but um you know let us know what you think and let us know who's in your team basically uh say less than a week to go now and it's getting very very close uh JC is there anything that you wanted to plug from your side yes um I guess if if you hadn't heard um myself uh sirel and trout and Jorgen who are prominent members in the analytics Community as well um most people will know about so talp he's sort of the he's got his own podcast FPL optimized um and you've probably seen all his charts on on on your Twitter on here on here and on here of course on here um so most people should be familiar but we're we're making our own FPL uh tool that we're really excited about um so that'll be coming out in early 2025 um we'll be posting updates via a newsletter in the runup to that so if you go to fpl optimize tocom signup you can sign up for that newsletter um so we think we've got some new innovative ideas that we want to bring to the community um and build a sort of state-of-the-art user friendly tool there stuff that we think we haven't seen on the market that we want to bring forward and obviously there's the power of optimization um and and modeling and analytics but it's analytics for all it's uh we think there's going to something for everyone in there but um that's a plug for that um and to continue with the admin um I'm also teaming up myself with uh Emma Jump The Wave on Twitter I think most people will be familiar with her um predicted lineups uh data um so it's like High m predictions for the top I think it was nine teams we did last year um so I'll be taking over the data side of that with her um but we are looking for new predictors so if you can message at Jump The Wave on uh Twitter if you're uh a fan of of uh particularly Spurs um city and uh Chelsea um but all all the top teams so um yes look forward to that admin done admin beautiful back to the Pod salanki salanki let's just go let's just go to salanki because he's in hey I've noticed that I've started calling him salanki and not big Dom but I when he was at Bournemouth I always just called him big Dom yeah now he's that way I feel like you'd be like on' be more I should be more familiar you're on first named Herms now come on big oh Big D how good how good was the uh how good was the reveal the um the Tweet earlier because because 12 years ago when he was when he was 14 years old he tweeted saying just turned up to the Tottenham training ground it's amazing or something like that and he did uh he did a little video that said uh just an update it is actually amazing which I thought was BR I realized I'd never heard him speak and I didn't expect him to speak like that no me neither quiet Dom quite Dom yeah excited me I'm excited you're excited I've been a Dom sanki fan since since he moved up with Bournemouth and no one wanted to pick him until reviews model came out went oh maybe salanki is quite good um and uh yeah he's been really good 19 goals last season was it that was pretty impressive and a miss penalty when we all caped him um is yeah I think I think he'd be a really good fit for SP his availability is one of his big assets as well which is something that's been a little lacking with poor old R charison Who yeah I mean he's done more than double the minutes of Charon isn't he it's it's this sh it but 3,330 minutes I mean more than everything he's six' two and we need him in both boxes you know again today we played a friendly and it was like I mean first half we didn't have either of our starting center backs in the team but you were like my God we need Dom we need Dom both boxes we need we need we need P 6'4 vaner 6'2 salanki I don't know how big Romero is but he's nasty anyway so we just we he does he does things um we need lots of big players and it's a lot easier to prep for set pieces your players are always on the pitch you can have more of a plan of where someone will be and he's there um quite interesting you know 19 goals from 19.6 XG um you s us beforehand that the finishing isn't traditionally been been particularly strong yeah I think actually like if you look at poot XG data um or just even gos versus XG you can often use like a yeah there there's a finishing model that you can use that kind of calculates roughly how much you're expecting this player to convert their XG into gold um and the Darwin Nunes who is often remarked as terrible finisher um actually scores more highly than uh Dom sanki does um the Dom's the best finisher but if you making all these chances um you can match the average and yeah it's fine he's good good player but yeah finishing is maybe he might be a frustrating asset to own an FPL but uh great that's fine if other people get frustrated I'll buy them I mean we spoke about it we spoke about it as part of the bonus pod and we were talking about specifically how it impacted him and we you know we spoke about the fact that he didn't pick up as many benefits from shots on target as Strikers and that because you know we're looking for well at the time we were looking for Strikers in in middling teams right that were going to that were going to score in a game that you know maybe they lose 2-1 or 3-1 or something and you know could that be a six-point goal type thing I think that's what I was saying obviously now he's going to move to to Spurs and hopefully becomes hopefully does just get a lot more chances you know I'd hope that that XG number increases um just by just by volume I mean how how high can it go we don't I mean we'll just have to wait and see I guess yeah but um yeah team XG gets about a 20% bump based on totam versus Bournemouth so does help him it is something to think about though isn't it that he has got one of the lowest baselines or bonus already um which didn't change hugely changed a little bit but didn't change hugely because he misses a lot miss the target you know not not just misses but misses the target qu um so you do Wonder in you know it's slightly easier for him to get bonus under Bournemouth than it would be against Tottenham because he's the Talisman isn't he and then he comes into a team where there's lots of players that can score bonus and do those things so yeah he a bit You' seen it with Harland almost haven't you is that Harland has to get two goals to get the bonus because all the other players also contribute it could be similar with salanki I out he will have many one goal nine pointers um I think the the bonus is important and obviously we should Factor it in but like the dominant fact is going to be how many goals you can get so like It Gos half million but no bonus then maybe that's fine um and the markets had him projected around 15 or 16 goals um when he was at Bournemouth and they've taken the markets down because he moving across and they're not back up yet but I was talking to Rob uh T who also friend of the Pod um just to get an idea of where we where we thought they might come back up at and actually I think if you factor in that um spurs' points predictions have gone up very slightly and Son's goals have gone down very slightly then actually we could probably put salanki around maybe where where isack is in sort of like this 18 19 goal Mark um that's not to say you can't get more obviously that's the sort of central point of the estimation um but yeah he's going to he's we're expecting him to score a few more goals but it's not it's not drastic he's not suddenly up at 2425 um but uh CU also there's there's you know he had pens before whereas now probably takes them but does son keep them or I guess there's some UNC we get them but I think losing pens is a fair bit of a loss um yeah and yeah small bonus loss but actually you offset that with a few goals he's probably he's probably not a hugely better asset in FPL I think the biggest change is that he's got a different set of fixtures for the opening six um correct which which are a lot better uh Bournemouth aren't great I was looking at maybe starting with Tony and moving over to him but um yeah I think he's he's a marginally better FPL asset but we should we shouldn't be expecting that suddenly we've got a 25 goal Striker at Spurs we'll see we'll see we'll see emotions my emotions I do think obviously he didn't he didn't play at all today so he won't play you know before before we go but um couple of key things one is that our game isn't until the Monday night so there's a fair amount of time I suspect there's some kind of Behind Closed Doors game this week bear in mind we not play to Monday night yeah they'll they'll do something even it's would you you expect him to start game with one oh yes okay yeah well we did have Andre come out and say he likes people hitting the ground running and he's but V's the sort of like Benchmark to do isn't it beware of manager quotes yeah van started three days after turning up um so so there is like I say the fact that we played again today the fact that we're just still conceding these set piece goals and so forth and you're like well what do you need well we need bodies we definitely need bodies in there that you know it's it's too easy to win the first header for us you know it's not most of the set piece goals we score conceder aren't even like the first header they're like they're like anyone can win that and put it back to where they want to and then it's dangerous you know what I mean is I can tell I can tell you're a Spurs fan in that like one of the main talking points you've got for Dom salanki signing is oh we won't have to concede as many set peace goals that you've been frustrated with all year yeah it's big though it's a huge huge thing for us amusing that's not what I would been thinking about yeah yeah no no but I didn't have to endure all of that so yeah and yeah some part and it probably kills Brena Johnson as an asset in fbl I think you reckon the right just based on koski's been comfortably our best player comfortably our best player all preseason playing as the nine but like if you want a clue from preseason taking Brennan off at halime to then put kulvi on that right hand side he made eight changes at half time the only two Outfield players he kept on was son and kesi kind of a reason for that like and he put him out back out to the right just feels like to me it just feels like just feel like kvi Kane son it's just Ki Dom son it's all right I don't know maybe I don't I don't I don't know I just wonder it depends on he's going to ask son to do because otherwise how you know because an is very clear in his in his way of attacking the by line um and I just can't see kiski just getting down that right hand side and cutting back I granted I didn't watch a lot of the second half today I watched the first half but not the second so maybe he did a lot of that today he got he got he got free plenty he gets free plenty you know he go behind plenty the fact is that brenon Johnson has comfortably been our worst player in every single game of PR pre season like not just bad like we're like one out of 10 bad in every single game that's quite bad like he I don't I I don't think he's made more than a half I think every single half it's like get him off we have just ripped him out of the team every okay I'd be genuinely unbelievably shocked Johnson lined up on the team on Monday night because that's the only 45 that kulu's play out on the right then PR season well he justed up in the last in the previous game he he played that went out to the right the second half he plays nine and then just clears off to the right in the second half so what he's been doing in most of these ones because he has to take Brennan off because he doesn't do anything Brennan played 75 against Munich by Munich the one and uh like 60 against Vel Kobe of course Kobe very important game for our very important game FPL planning um but yeah he Brenan will always look like a bad player because he does because his worst thing is touching the ball that's that's the worst aspect of Bren Johnson is is you never want him touching the ball you just you want H you want to set up things where he either arrives into the box and puts the ball in or he gets in behind and cuts the ball back across to someone else to do you know he is a he's a moment player um he's not a player that you give the ball and do the stuff with but um and you never know you never know it the first two games are Leicester and Everton but Newcastle and Arsenal that's definitely not going to be R Johnson I think even if like there's min's uncertainty around picking him then what salanki joins from an FPL perspective not even just mins is there's another Spurs asset we might want like I've got three some people are looking at four in their teams to start with um son's still good parro's still good vicario's still good van Deen's Not a Bad 4.5 Yogi is still good like there are lots of other players and there are other 6.5s so Johnson is a good 6.5 if you think he plays but you can easily move into someone else and get yeah another Spurs player somewhere else so I think the maximum you could ever ever like if you're adjus in his minutes the max you could ever put him would be 65 on Brenan that be I just don't see a world in which you could put more than that on him um but I think I think it's very unlikely he plays much not not much but because we've got a lot of games we got Europa this season we didn't have that that space is is but also the other thing is is that we know this week we know this week that prior to Chelsea going for Pedro Netto and probably what triggered the Pedro Netto move is that we were in for Pedro Netto yeah like it wasn't get they weren't going to get Pedro Netto to be like yeah yeah son you don't need to play they were getting Pedro Nets though because they want a dribbling man out on the right hand side um that's the other reason why it's like for it's all a bit he's still in for E well that's that's another one that's the other one and the other doors are closing you know uh um I think I've have heard that Ryan churkey maybe we might be looking at as another option that's there but I do think as this window goes on for Man City who clearly are you man city were looking at pedron Netto as well as where we looking at Pedro Netto so you've got two teams that have money man city have got money because of the AZ deal that and we still have um comfortably have money to spend on 60 70 million on a player um but yeah I I still think one of those two teams will go heavy for NE for EO and I think it'll be in the next few days um does does salanki remain a 90 minute man if you've got other options let's say e comes in and you got Johnson and son and Ki and RIS and and I I mean they're not probably not all going to be fit at the same time but is Dom still 90 minute guy Spurs do you reckon I'm not sure he's not going to have he's not going to be as secured as he was at Bournemouth obviously um and if Rich charison stays then then yeah there's there's a risk I just don't see unless he's having an absolute horror show in which case you know we we're not going to be looking to Pi him anyway I think he will spend most of the game on the pitch so if you're not you're not going to place I'd have him 80 minutes plus to be honest i' I'd have him 80 minutes plus but he's not going to be in the you know what you'd see on review with the 86 87 I wouldn't I wouldn't have that as a would have it quite there just because the players are there un certainty is it yeah but as you dial his up it does potentially dial Suns down but you know is is we know that you know it's it last season if you Von very R like quite often would come off on like 70 minutes or so if he was playing number nine and quite often what then happened was Sun would stay on the pitch and move into the nine um you know so you could bring someone on and do all that stuff but I'm like if the number Nine's always on the pitch like sun's not getting younger one of the worst things we've done is like overuse him realistically over the last last few years I mean if we're going to put anything on preseason as well there's absolutely no reason why Dei couldn't play in the middle there as well kvki couldn't couldn't move in there if you wanted to do Dom off at 75 Hulu into the middle and Brennan on type Vib so I that's available right that's just that's there as a as a possibility now yeah yeah there is this is the issue there's four attacking roles in the the sort of left 10 and which is madow but we know that mad rarely is a NIC minute man again so quite often last season we had Madison would go off and kvi would come off the right into the 10 and then Johnson would come on so that can happen we could have now salanki comes off and Ki goes to the nine and Johnson comes on we've also got verer who can come on for the last 10 15 minutes forgot about him um Defenders charlan as well and we want another attacking player in there um yeah it does get a bit awkward it would be really really really nice over the next few days to get some kind of clarity on it um but I guess as soon as salanki came in I was like well I just put him in yep Adam have you put him in yeah I've put him in JC yeah yeah he's in he's in I even I even changed his kit on my on my screen even though it's not when we look at our drafts he's in a Bournemouth kit for me and Baker and he's in a he's in a Spurs kit for you I thought in the right in the right kit this is when you know like people think you know what what did the older analytics Community do and there's like you know they all think everyone's yeah yeah change the kits before the players important bit that's what wins the game extra e that's what wins the game yeah that's what wins the game and you change the fixture as well yeah yeah yeah yeah what do you think this is Amateur hour easy not that hard I'll teach you we actually have to do is change the name of the player you don't even change the rest of it did which way around did you do it that's an interesting one did you actually check did you actually put the kit in and the fixture in or did you actually just change San's name from someone else ah I changed the kit in the fixture you could have just yeah I could I could have just put a he could have just put that's not optimal Jas oh well oh he was already in well could have put richison in there and just changed his name to salanki I thought of that yeah oh well oh we should probably we should probably move on to some drafts is this what the podcast listeners want to hear about they want they want to see your draft they want to see man top 1K top 2K I've got r um no uh I have put quadruple spurs in just because uh you can at the moment yeah it's important to know you can't you know what I hadn't done it until you said and now I've immediately will I think the issue is is that when you have to make a transfer you have to sell one of them you can't like sell Gabrielle for CBA so the team's got to be right when you go into gameweek one which I don't think it will be I'm not intending to do this but it's a viable draft um so if nothing changes maybe and if we sign as you get five oh God yeah are you are you guys looking it don't take isach off us please um I'll read it out for the audio listeners uh we've got Vicario in goal uh porro Trent and Gabrielle at the back son as a Bruno Fernandez sacka salanki in his SP kit J Pedro and isach are then a bench of whatever 4.0 put Danny Ward in here uh and kungu dunk and coner so this this is the Nomi as people are calling it despite that being a very silly term um son and sakur are premiums basically I don't know what this is about but um yeah I think Harland drafts are viable Salah drafts are viable I don't think both is viable and I do think none is viable I think if you put both in you're just you're too restricted in what you're doing elsewhere and you've got these two big shiny players that are better than everyone else but I don't think it's worth it harland's a lot of money Holland's very expensive um in fact he's what six million more than the next best next most expensive Striker so you take him out and you suddenly you got six million already which maybe for flexibility purposes is nice because you can start with him and easily get to to a seller um but yeah I don't think there's anything well apart from quadruple Spurs and double Spurs defense I was say I don't think there's anything too controversal in here um but uh feel free to pick it apart no I just feel I feel with if you like you said like with both Harland and Salah I also feel like the first transfer you make is going to have to move one of them because you're going to want to do something with that money and yeah the fixtures have been set out in such a way that I think if if let's say the IP I mean this is you know this isn't happening but if like IP switch for Liverpool was gameweek one and then IP switch was gameweek three or four for City I think you might have seen some people starting with one and moving to the other more more so I don't think because because it's game week two obviously you have to take a minus four to make that happen if you want that fixture twice and no one no one in the world is doing that um so yeah I can't see going with going with both is is good um because then equally harland's got what Arsenal in gameweek five so like if you wanted to hit the best of Salah and harand you start with Salah you go to Harland then you got get back to Salah because salah's got a good game in four or five I think and harland's got tough one in five so like and then you got go back off them all your transfers are focused on just him those two players yeah including probably a hit or maybe wild time yeah yeah uh so I don't think I think but kind of once you get your head on that if you go okay I'm probably going to have have to go without either Salah or Harland against it switch in one or two then you're like okay I've got to do a scary fixture then why not do both basically um why I do both there's no because I think if if it's close if it was like close between putting both of them in or not I think both would be more viable because you go okay I don't want to be I don't want the fomo I don't want to go without but I think it is a little expensive in terms of the EV that you're spending to to do that and the flexibility um without both is a bit is quite hard to get to one I guess is it is it nether though because um one of the things where I looked at if I was to go both I actually found it quite hard to make transfers almost tit space so I feel like there is a there is like a utopian world where going both and then say wild card in six could be like if you got lucky the best way to get to Wild carding without having made a transfer it is it is possible in that sense and and if that did happen then it's like oh that's works out lovely but football doesn't rely work out that way I think also you're you're either forced to having to sell Salah or harand for funds or making an unusual move because you've got a seller 5.5 and you've already got both of the good ones in you're kind of stuck so you're kind of restricted in that sense yeah yeah you're fishing every single move is a very small pole you're looking and the the the the model projections across various sources and and our solvers are kind of suggesting that actually putting both of them in isn't significantly if at all better across the first games so like lines with one or neither or both one or neither are coming out comparable if not ahead so you're forgoing flexibility and you're forgoing a bit of expected value and that might be fine if you really have fomo over those two games you've just got to be aware that you're kind of you're buying some comfort with that you're spending a bit of expected value to get that comfort and that's you're allowed to do that I'm not knocking that but if you think it's like this is going to be way better maybe it gets more points it does who knows maybe a team with 10 million in the bank gets more points normally a team who starts in game week two is ahead of me within the first few weeks because why not um but I think yeah the there are plenty of reasons not to get both not only just it doesn't tend to score as highly um because we get really fixated on these premium single players and the captaincy and obviously Harland gameweek 2 home RS which is that's a lot of points it's not like you're going without him saying I don't think he'll score you're just saying I think I can make that up add more with with the six and a half million with the six and a half million and um this based on something like this in terms of the path that would lead to would that uh probably lead to Salah coming in in four uh likely yeah because I think game fall is a bit fiddly for captaincy I think what I'd more likely do with this team is well I can Captain Bruno or um I think's got sampton and's got um got Spurs and then City isn't he and and obviously and obviously son has the Newcastle and Arsenal in 3 four so it's like there is that space where you attack those couple of opening two to three fixtures with those see how that plays out and then you move one of those twin tens as it were um onto it but also I do still think I like I keep it's like Palmer like like nobody's got Palmer in their team well they' priced them correctly they priced him correctly and nobody's got fent in their team and in that space and they're both week one doubts is that right yeah but yeah but you you suddenly get to game week three and foden scored a hat-trick against IP switch and you go oh Christ how do I get to foden where does he fit um but then if you rush him in he's got Arsenal in five so yeah yeah yeah yeah I think I mean you you have to make sacrifices somewhere you can't own everyone so um I don't think there's a viable sacka son Palmer and foden team you have to go that e do you think the introduction I mean obviously like say sanki was already a viable Choice wasn't he but he has now suddenly got better opening fixtures and it really is still the opening fixtures you we're looking at because we do get transfers and we do have wild cards and all those type of stuff do you think that salanki moving to Tottenham impacts the decision that might see more people go the Salah way then go the Harland way I think so yeah I think actually this this front line or something similar um I think before sanki had joined and before Tony wasn't involved in the brenford game today I think I was quite Keen to start with isack Tony and Ja Pedro or mun or something like that and then Tony can move to salanki when bma's fixtures got better um and try and fit Sellar in by probably an unu dangr or something here um if I wanted to whereas I think before that actually when I wasn't so Keen I think it was proba har and daac and CHP so jedro is Armstrong whoever um but I think son's maybe a slightly worse asset now just because of some of the goal share very marginally so I think that would push me towards Salah more so I that's a very small needle and maybe that's that's a misstep but yeah I don't know and also Holland didn't score today so probably shouldn't put it in yeah over um if SC a hat trick I think we would all been there um I'm joking um are you well I don't know I'm I'm joking about myself I wouldn't be swaying that way but people do that's what when Holland first signed wasn't it Darwin got a goal in the community shield and holl missed some chances and everyone was like ah maybe maybe we don't want him SW back to Kane he SC five go five goals in his first three games or something like that including like scor like three hat tricks in five games and everyone went ah [ __ ] yeah that's that's what we thought he was going to do oops the thing the thing when those things happen though in preseason like why I never had issues with it is we talk about the pushing of the needle like the the if your decision is if you're 51 Harland 49 s and he blanks today and they look a bit crappy and you start thinking that rodri is not going to play the first game yeah it's absolutely viable that you went from 5149 sah to Harland to go 4951 and and and flip it you know what I mean like like like everyone says oh why did you switch from that to that like what is this like it's like well I didn't I didn't start both at 100 and not you know what I mean I was somewhere between that I just slightly moved and that's okay yeah I I I still like mocking but I agree yeah it's uh it's funny um but also yeah I mean I'll do the same thing and actually I think what I'm sure when I was solving it um I was I wasn't super sure on Gabrielle I think I'm probably still will go with him but there's some doubts whether whether he's going to start or might be calori but then Timber had a knock and I'm sure I did some solves where I went like okay I'll ban Gabrielle and see and it's probably just going to be the same but it'll put CRA in and I'm sure it's swapped from like a Salah to a Harland structure because I went I don't want that that Arsenal Defender and you realize quite how close these These Little Things Are and actually like suddenly you know if e gets get injured then you might change eight players because that means that the structure has to change and therefore you're on Harland instead of Salah so all these knock on effects and the way the the players interact is I think that's why it's amusing because a small thing happens and you go oh change my entire draft whole team changes this guy's out doesn't fit anymore um whereas when actual fact what's happened is you know the markets have slightly cooled on this team or um one guy got injured um I haven't been paying attention to sort of discussions around minutes for a few of these players and I'm thinking primarily the ones that still haven't we really haven't seen in preseason because they've only just come back so we know you know we know from the city lineup today right they played with Nico O'Reilly James mcky Oscar Bob because none of them are back but loads and loads of drafts I see around analytics particularly have Trent and zaka and I understand that these players are obviously great value on a longer term Horizon but where's the what's the confidence level on players like Trent actually starting gameweek one when Conor Bradley is just there and you know we we all know the story around sacka and and and that because it's you know I imagine you don't want to go into gameweek one with 17 and a half million pounds worth of players that don't start yeah I guess I have got J Pedro and concer to come on but that's not yeah um yeah I mean I think certainly what I do I don't know if this is what all anst managers do is like my error bars on my certainty are massive a few weeks out and they just gradually get smaller and smaller and smaller and obviously the I'm only worried about Trent now because he didn't play whereas before I was like well he might play in the last game or he might not so actually at the minute I can't really say I don't know probably fine um and the same with Saka and obviously like Tony today so that's why I try and leave most of my effort to drafting in the last week because I just we don't know things early on and obviously you can spend time reacting to what's going on for friendlies out um but for example yeah if Trent is suddenly looking like he's not going to start and there's rumors around the training ground or I don't know we get a leak or something then yeah I'm I'm still a bit worried about it but I still feel like especially sack sacka like sackers should just be straight in we know the way artetta has been with him um but yeah I think now is when I start to get worried about these players rather than um two weeks ago there's no point being worried about Trent I could see okay like he might be in he might not I can see how that affects the team um and play around with it but actually trying to do nitty-gritty xmin evaluation if you're not in the last week leading up to the game I have got the freedom that I'm I'm quite free this week so I can put lots of time into it which I know everyone doesn't have um but yeah I I feel like it's it's not wasted time doing it earlier because if you enjoy it that's fun but if I had If I Only Had I don't know five hours to put into planning my ex-men and assessing players and reading up on stuff I'd spent all of those in the last week I wouldn't put any of it earlier on Essen if I've got more time I'll have a look so yeah I'm still uncertain on and Trent um saako um I guess e might still be on the Move um Jal Pedro played 45 minutes today I think um isak's fine shalani should be in um but yeah there's plenty any others that still need assessment and seeing how they run so I'll be a lot more thorough this week I think this is a kind of structural thing but yeah I just wonder how how binary you have to think on in gameweek one when you do as you say you have you you do have Duncan K of there as as cover and then you and then you obviously benefit from having that player from gameweek two when you don't have to make a move to move him out so yeah if if I thought they weren't going to start I wouldn't start with them I don't think I'd pick a player so like if I think Trent I'm pretty sure Trent isn't starting but he's starting two on with I would imagine that the model the solver whatever we want to call it um would tell me that it's not worth putting him in and actually like I can gain Enough by picking someone else or starting with I don't know Virgil or cardal or moving a few things around yeah um to do that but I guess that's that's the kind of questions I will be asking this week when I go and run a solve I'll go okay what happens if Trent out um and then I know and then if I get a leak I go okay that's this scenario um so a lot of it is stress testing it and seeing what happens if this cuz if I for example if I solve it okay what happens if Trent isn't in game we one but then he's back afterwards and the solver is going like okay the the points of thing just stick with Trent anyway you can't gain enough then I don't have to worry about whether Trent's starting or not I just put him in yeah and hope he starts because I know that in the scenar that he doesn't start I should still have picked him that make sense yeah so occasionally you realize that the threshold is like below but I had imagine not starting game with one is enough to pick a similar asset um for most players um I actually can't think of one where I'd still go with them but I just think back to the I think back to the uh how how weird that that was it Arsenal and Manu had a blank game week one a few years ago how weird that must have been that must have been really strange yeah I think it was City man united I think City man united yeah City maned they because they had a weird double game week lat yeah I forgot about that yeah yeah it's like should we start with Bruto still he's not great game what do you mean do you want to move on where am I at so oh yeah well I was uh so I'm in a couple of places at the moment um I'm I'm actually more boths yeah so they're both mine so the draft on the left so the draft on the left is where I pretty much am um with with one kind of small change but I'll talk about that and then the right hand side is basically what this team looks like if I have to force Harland in so because uh you know I I did come out and say the other day that triple captain in game week 2 is very appealing and you know having that home home iwit IP switch fixture when I feel like the minutes are most secure feels like a really great opportunity to use that chip and get it out of the way as well um so on the left I've got I've got Rya Gabrielle viio horo you notice there's no Trend there so Salah Gibbs white son and ER xal Pedro isach and salanki it's the same front three as you had and then 4.0 keeper Harwood Bellis Anthony Robinson and Emil Smith row because they're great basically they're great for gameweek three where things starting getting a bit sticky for the Spurs boys and yeah so the only the only difference I had here was actually I had you know I I played straight into the he's got another assist today he's looked amazing again today and I had I had had Y in instead of Gibbs white which I thought was fun um and actually left with a million in the bank and it just felt weird having a million in the bank when people are people are stressing about what to do so I I really I really like this draft for the first three weeks four weeks um again there will be transfers to get more Liverpool in four and and then back to Arsenal in six but again as a game week one goes it's triple Spurs it feels great is that Captain you know everyone Everything feels good but moving on to just the the one on the right hand side I just wanted to sort of highlight how you mentioned you know you mentioned if say e was being taken out you might have to change eight players for example I mean like harand literally putting him in literally makes you change like everyone like but I've changed I've changed ryer to um R to Mar yeah uh I've changed Salah to e son to soas I want the Liverpool in there uh and then ja Pedro to to Harland there's four big changes there um and I just don't feel I'm not sure whether I feel as comfortable there although I do get them the option to Triple captain harl in gameweek two M there's a lot of sacrifice I feel like there's a lot of sacrifice there why you triple Captain MN game one there is you're going you're going to the game this is it yeah your oans in yeah exactly I am going to the game in uh I am going to Portland it's not as it's not as good as Holland at home no um so what so what do you feel like you're losing by bringing harand in from obviously Salah um I just think the combination of Salah and Salah and son is better than e and s vers well sorry so Salah son jaia Pedro as a three is better than e soas and Harland I mean the the the keeper I mean is I guess is what it is I mean they all get around about three four points a game anyway so there's no there's no difference there I don't know they're probably pretty close I don't know I haven't run this through I've only got had this in the app I haven't had time to actually run this through I don't know anything Scout Hub team review anything to see what actually drops off um and which one's a bit you know better structurally and has high higher expected points or value I don't know yet yeah I mean you could even make a couple of little changes on that like Smith if you said Smith went goes to Rogers for example then Gibbs white becomes e and then you you got e back you know what I mean you probably like these St and do or you can just do Rya back down to Martinez oh R to Martinez and you get you those in so it is interesting when you sent me that draft and I do look at the mo ones with with salanki as that person there and I'm like it's pretty good is and I asked you to do it that way didn't I where I said like yeah you've got Mo now put Holland in and see what you take out yeah because it forces you to just I've looked at it the other way around is because I've had harand in all of them and then you're like God where do I now spend all this money when I move him you know and I move Harland down to J Pedro or is one of those two but either way Suddenly It's like I've got nine million now to spend across the rest of my team it's like but it's hard would would these have a wild card penciled in at any particular point or is that would that be open or even different across the two I'm relatively I'm relatively indifferent um I'm pretty much of the opinion you can wild card in four and wild card in six and they're both pretty much the same thing because either way you're going to want to make transfers in four or six to get to get assets in anyway so I think it's a I think four and six is more based on circumstance rather than ra rather than anything else I think if you're if you're in a good situation then you can probably transfer through six transfer through four and then wild card in six and I think if you get yourself in a bit of a situation where some injuries come in or you know someone gets dropped Etc outside of the periphery of your transfers that you're going to make then wild card four transfer six I think they're interchangeable I really think they are yeah I think like there's still scenarios where you sort of transfer through both or yeah kind of kind of espe if you get quite lucky you know for it and not have to make other transfers and that sense but um but I think there are some real like six Arsenal obviously Chelsea the Brighton and Forest games at home you've got this you got quite a few teams who've got the double home so Arsenal have got the double Home Chelsea got the double home brenford have got the double home um where they they a nice couple of pairs of fixtures where yeah I do I do like that more whereas think in for it's kind of Watkins and Sal is the bits where you look at it I think I think if you're going to work on in four you probably want a slightly different game with one team because you can make some more gains on one to three yeah as well as play get in for whereas actually the team that gets to game week six and then wild cards is pretty similar to the team that will play through it's just whether you want to play it or whether you're forced to through injuries or whatever whereas four is probably going to be a bit different I think um I think gameweek four is probably it's probably a Harland team rather than a solo one um I don't know um I was just thinking about what what you guys said on your like end of season pod last year I went back and watched it to see if we've remembered our learnings um because you talked about attacking the season with there was three things you can attack with which is Chip strategy your player picks and your captaincy so obviously triple Captain game week two is kind of both in one go um but I think that's viable if if that's one of your ones of like I want to dial the a bit of risk up and get something different as well as not going something that's really going to H for me later because you might have had Harland anyway you've not like moved him in to do the triple captaincy these are probably both quite similar teams I'd imagine so if you wanted to do that I think that's quite a good way to kind bite into that risk appetite um I probably won't do it because I I'll save it but I don't think playing it in two is like it's not an expens i if we talk about like um if you're solving for whatever the optimal team is under whatever conditions you're you're doing every time you make a little tweak from that well some of it is like testing it because this you know there's an assumption that you've made that maybe isn't quite true but if you assume that kind of team that you maybe don't quite like because it's got Douglas Luise in it or whatever every time you want to go oh I'd rather play harand and triple Captain him you're almost buying that preference so I think triple captaining Harland in two is a pretty cheap preference to buy whereas doing well I was going to say bench boost one well card 2 I think that's a bit more expensive of a like an attacking chip strategy um so I I think here there's a few options for do you want to attack early and that should probably be whether you want to go Holland or cell because both of them look quite strong is that a question kind in Balance yeah because you said you said then because you said if you said Wild Card 4 might lean towards more towards a Harland team so would you then would that be another way to dial up a little bit more and say right I'm going to Wild Card in four this is going to happen and I'm going to attack the first three game weeks triple Captain har in two and then you know wild card in four and basically you know start again with else in front of me yeah I think it's it's quite a viable strategy it's one I have seen a lot of analytics managers looking at it it's not like it's one that's you know some crazy idea people come up with I'm not saying that if analytics aren't on it that it's crazy but um yeah I think s was looking at it was that the numbers come um ah he's crazy analytics like me in in a different way um yeah Wild Card 4 is very viable and the value of our wild card this season is much less so playing it in a slightly especially the first one because we don't know where the doubles are we don't know we don't have a Myster chip to deal with yet um so playing in four I think is especially if you can pick a team that's competitive for the first three weeks that's a bit different that's not a bad way to kind of go okay the the issue is is that you are gambling on your well card for Te might have to be a bit less exciting because you need it to last you don't have your you know but your gameing 1 to3 team can be a little bit different so I'd attack pre Wild Card rather than with the wild card playing it where it is is the attacking that makes sense because otherwise you're attacking with the Chip And The Players because you're going okay I'm to wild card and if M hasn't started and you go he's going to start now I'm G to wild card into M then you're you're buying a problem and you don't have your wild card to fix it um so that's possibly a way to do it but you you don't have to do both you could triple Captain one and wild card later or you could a triple Captain Harland in in two or you could attack it with four I think bench boost was the one I was quite looking at to is there something here but I think sadly it's not quite quite there as as enticing as the free hit bench boost one looks the 15 man free hit then wild Cen two I yeah it is an interesting thing though isn't it one is the it's the only time yeah and treat it as a free hit so G so World card straight out of it because no one ever gets to do that that's it yeah is but to have a whole set of 15 players and then just say see you later to them yep but then your W Cod 2's got to be pretty is it your can what I wonder if the what if the mystery chips at what the mystery chip allows us to what a free hit boost yeah um they're going to call it a free boost they're not particularly original I I don't know may that's what they'll do I feel like it's got to be something simple to program into the game um yeah I I have no idea I'm not I think we're possibly wasting our time talking about what the mystery chip might be yeah but I don't think they've decided basically I'd be surprised if they know let's have a look at yours let's have a look at yours Baker let's move on to yours food for thought there yes yeah definitely definitely you know we said I mean I'm yeah I've kind of half moved back to this this Salah uh draft because because I'm going to be at Portman Road and I wonder is that is that it's genuinely I'm getting T now I'm learning this definitely isn't isn't our learning that going to a game on game one you have to move this player in it's like the opposite of what we said we were going to I'm excited for the 2425 season review to be that worked really well what I should do is go to more games where my players are playing because it inspires them is that what you see it being yeah something like that maybe something like that yeah nice as you said like it makes sense why why don't you just go to the etti Hat tr get tickets for that g we do to just try and get in there so that I can triple Captain him yeah yeah maybe maybe I should just do that I did once watch a h who is it Newcastle beat brenford 51 and it was a consolation 90th minute penalty uh by Tony and I had a triple Newcastle defense and I was there so I saw a triple clean sheet wipe out in front of me it was great my God Dan burn who I owned as well he hand balled it for the penalty um that was that was a moment 5 no need I'm like oh God lost all the bonus Nightmare funny nightmare so don't go to games don't don't watch football don't watch football Baker this is these are yours talk us for him so on the right here for I watching the um is the team that I was on PRI salanki felt like I was really comfortable oh did I get the the wrong way around on this team is they're fine they're fine I know but M mine were the other way around so well good which was um which was Harland I've been Harland only probably since about the first week is is I've sat in that space where I'm not comfortable with the keeper I've got Henderson in goal at the moment it's partially because I really hate fleen I've got just uh I think I'd be I'd be more comfortable in Henderson now that Conant looking to lead yeah I like that more I'm just not sure on on Palace you know I'm I'm quite down on palace with the Alisa move coming out you know is is like that's only won one game where Alisa didn't play you know since joining is is is a big deal Mata comes off the World Cup if there's if there's a go gay goes if he were those guards something like do I want to just be stuck with palace's keeper I'm not I'm not as convinced on that I am you know even brenford keeper I'm starting to maybe start West Ham's keeper again the fixtures are terrible but but the fact is is is that they keep players too is fantastic that's true like the first 11 if you put it down for for for West you like w i mean p is still playing somehow but he is playing um it's yeah it's definitely not Matt Matt sales and fleen is definitely something where the fixtures are there but I just that's definitely yeah that's definitely my take myem motion of my side I I think like my rule of thumb is I will pick the wrong 4.5 keeper and I just go okay that's fine so I'll just pick one I'll pick one it be the wrong one move on yeah there we go exactly um so I had porro viol and uh at the moment I've got your lovely lisis Hall very nice really want someone for the first two weeks I'm not bothered after two weeks I like not so much yeah not much because Barco can come in can he barco's fixtures are fantastic play yeah but conza you can play cono 3 four five six easy I mean the one on the right I've got a bit fancy mat might not yeah so it's probably anyway it's like you it's Matson until the minute say otherwise and then it's that is um but I look at you know Leicester Everton wol Zips which and then you've obviously got Fulham and Bournemouth in eight and n as well so I'm like if I needed to just play him all the time yeah yeah um meleno I don't mind for the first couple not well first one I certainly I don't mind him first one yeah but it's there you go sorted but I just quite like the player in in hall now you're a Newcastle fan so I'm going to come back to you on that one um and then my Midfield was Bruno and kungu as a and I'm very close in son saaka I think if Saka is absolutely fine I probably probably will be there there's definitely some heart be head but like today I see leester Lo leester put out full team and they lose fre nil to lws and I'm like God but still like absolutely hammered again you like and people are saying like I saw a tweet and it basically said you know is anyone as a manager ever been sacked before the season starts and you're like you know the idea of of of him there and then I had Harlem manisan is was mine front fre um that was you know I I was surprised that Pedro started today that seemed to just suddenly come straight back into fruition but um uh he'd only play 45 but yeah he did scored a good goal though very good goal scored a very good goal um and then sanki I was like right if he comes in what would I just on this team what are my changes um you don't have to change a huge amount I basically just took Matson down to concert um and Bruno changes to Gordon and and Son becomes sacka son just switched to sacka well obviously knock on effect knock on effect yeah knock on effect because I no because no because simply like son coming in is a tiny little dip against Sun I know yeah it is a tiny little dip against Sun you know I just thought it Wasing there was like a structural change in and I just swapped my 10 million midfielders I just swap my 10 milfield but yeah they are the 51 I was saying about you know and I do think I'm with you should should it be there um and it I don't think that's a huge it it doesn't feel to me like particularly huge sacrifices for me and a harlem team so I think it's very easy for me to look at it and go okay that's not a huge amount but the interesting one was when I just changed to this team on the left then Adam sent through and he was like sellah and I'm like but you what you can do that that that that that that that that that maybe salanki does open up the mo draft more than it does the Harland draft um it is part of that kind of quite emotional part of it isn't it because it does feel like you're very much of a I I went on Camp Mo versus I went on Camp earling um my one thing is on both of these draft whatever it is is that I would almost certainly bring Mo still in on four and there's a couple of ways you can do it but it's slightly easier on my original draft so on the original draft esac if esack goes to Pedro in four and you just stick on to Mar it's a pretty easy way of doing it there's another way of doing it you could do Harlem to Watkins and that enabl you you go Bruno to Mo there's a couple of ways in which you would do it but I do think I would end up bringing Mo in and four unless we see something very odd over the next few weeks um so yeah like you said about the flexibility of a mo and Har draft having it for five weeks I'm not sure I enjoy that having it maybe for two weeks if I did it for four and five I don't mind that I don't mind that anywhere near as much but I think I'd only probably do that if I was definitely wild card in N six um but you would also by doing that way you wild card with not a huge number of transfers in your bank yeah I think that's a tricky one is like when when they said you could roll through the Wild Card completely change what I was thinking about what what we were doing crazy never seen that before that's crazy moving it to F transfers I'm like well I've played games where there's more rolling I'm I know like well it changes it but I kind of know how to to do with that roll through the wild card with that yeah it's a really big deal so yeah I need to go and have a think about s draft I need to have a think and and like I say it's is once I've have got a bit myself emotionally invested to well I'm going to have a Harland do I not um you are a Newcastle fan I am so we've shown five drafts only one of them had Anthony Gordon in and only mine had a Newcastle defender in yep any questions what the questions what the question questions are good they are good yeah well I mean sampton is the first one obviously that's the that's the main big one let me just get them um who we got then Bournemouth burs wolves colum City yeah the first four definitely um B Wolves Away not as good I think um especially the Defenders I think the there is uncertainty around who's going to start I think we've got well botman and um lels are both out injured for the for ball B's May back sooner than we thought um trippier is still not really sure whether he's staying or going I think if trippier goes liento is um pretty nailed at right back so he'd be the the pick I reckon but um more for Min certainty over Hall I think Hall's a bit more attacking and a bit better gol threat um an assist but Hall has I think he has started every preseason game or at least most of them so he certainly looking to be like trusted a bit more so if I was looking for a short-term punt I think I would go hall for slightly better upside over burn but I wouldn't put it past how to go trippier sha gahi burn if gahi comes um whereas if gahi doesn't join or another Center back doesn't join I think burn will play left Center back for the foreseeable I don't I don't really see Kelly's more rotation option or cover um I don't think Kelly is going to be starting uh soon unless there's a surprise so it probably is burn and Hall unless we buy another Center back at Le to start with sha is nailed he's fine but obious he's 5 and a half million um and then it's trippo or Lio right back but that depends who's at the club um I think we've got a few more options on the wing now we have now got Gordon and Barnes fit Barnes was out for a long time last year and is a really good player um so I saw some I think it was the planet FPL correspondent was talking about he thought it'd be Barnes and M Murphy starting game week one which I'm not sure about I feel like Gordon's still good enough to be commanding that position but Gordon can play on the right Murphy's been good so like there are two spots and three players he hasn't started preseason yet though is he Gordon he's not back yet he played last night played last night play minutes we had um SE we had a double header so we had a game on Friday and yesterday or today um so there was like different starting 11s in both so Barnes played one Gordon played one so that's really useful yeah it was Gordon was unbelievable last night like like for 45 minutes he was just like yeah he looked quicker than I've ever seen him play like he was physically he's yeah I I occasionally I don't I would preface this with like I'm a Newcastle fan rather than a Newcastle analyst so the yeah there is emotion and bias in here and I don't pretend to know all the ins and outs and all the tactics so like I I watch Newcastle more than I watch any other club because it's where I'm from um but it is like I I prefer to just watch and enjoy it it's emotion for me rather than like oh what's all the tactics going on here um that but uh yeah my opinions my emotion my team um so I I don't have any inside knowledge but then again most people who talk about this is going to be the 11 they don't really know either but even if you did know let's just say we knew let's just say Eddie how turned up and said which he never does and if he does he lies I wouldn't trust him if he did yeah yeah but let's just say anony Gordon's playing 90 minutes for every single game here on in does he still get not get in your team um I don't think I'd start with him still I think uh I'd need e to not to Le because E's got pens Gordon unless isack and Wilson aren't on the pitch um and I think with no Wilson I think isak's going to be playing nearly 90 because he's we've got one game a week There's No Europe uh and he is fit enough to do that when he's not injured so Gordon's not going to get pens he would get some he'd get corners and maybe a few free kicks if trippier goes um which is a bit of a plus but I just think e is a better asset with penalties and matching his goal threat roughly um so and I don't really see a a structure that I like where I need e and Gordon and he is 7.5 so actually like I have Ean and kungu in my team and I don't see anywhere where I'd want to find 0.5 or a million to get e and Gordon but I'm not saying Gordon is not a good pick at all again I think that's that there's there's player there's two parts in FPL which I think is probably one of the analytics tips is like there's player evaluation and projections and then there's finding the best team from those evaluations so if I go without Harland you're not saying well harland's not going to score against IP switch IP switch are very solid defensively you're just saying like he's so expensive that this structure around him so I think Gordon's a really good player and a good asset and I think he ran maybe a little hot last year especially in the home games um but there's some threat from bares there some threat from Murphy um I don't think he's like a guaranteed I can't believe more people don't have him pick whereas isach playing with pens there are some builds where you can go like well harand salanki munes or Pedro or something like that um without isack which I think can be viable and I might even look at that for a bit of relative race but probably keep um but Gordon is he's probably just our best attacker rather than an amazing 7.5 is my player but even was amazing not away yeah's going to be starting um but there's some risk of barn and Gordon um yeah and I think defensively I think we should sh up defensively because we've got Pope back who was a big loss um um and we've got our Midfield destroyers with Bruno and Jon and soon to be tanali so I don't expect us to be as poor defensively as we were last year but I think the year before that they were very strong they were like top four defenses and I'm not sure we're going to see a top four defense but the attack is where it's at which is why everyone's basically just picked isach and no one else yeah which probably boringly the right play but there's options you can expl especially if you're doing bench boost one Wild Card 2 um I don't I don't like I don't dislike Hall Hall's a good pick I think um if I was picking a short term I'd pick allall of any of them if I was going any longer than that I'd probably just avoid I don't think BN is depends on gayy news don't know think watching him Friday night was that one jool Inon you just kind of forgot how much he Le the press and how I love him he's so good it's just so powerful like he was just like Christ I just forgot like he's such a weirdly Dynamic player like he's like just odd you know it's it makes me feel like Spurs fans mus demal in a way of you've got this guy that people just don't really know what to do against him and that's exactly how he was it was he set up so many counters in that first half where he just barged through people and was like I'm off we're off um um Paul was good he's almost like too brave on the ball quite often he gave away the ball in some silly positions by trying to play out in a in a in a fun way but you're at some point they go just yeah what isn't he 18 so yeah yeah from a fan perspective very excited like he's going to be a great player in in the coming Seasons but Gordon yeah and even even the fact of Jo Lon back just felt like it was good for Gordon as well because it was like oh I've got this left-sided enter midfielder there he just go and um but yeah the way he accelerated for his goal um and hea was just everywhere he was everywhere he he sometimes in in a way the fact that he's everywhere makes him not like a fall number nine and when they put the balls into the box suddenly like Joe lon's crash in the Box you've got somebody else that's quite big and someone else is around it so I'm like [Music] H maybe he's not as talisma as as I'd like him to be as a striker but yeah and and he missed the penalty so you immediately think you know I'm sure it'll be fine I think the I guess the counter the Counterpoint to him being everywhere is that actually like he's one of these players who can create something from anywhere yeah so like sometimes you're like oh what what's this number nine doing on the wing get back in the Box you're not helping there whereas if Isa picks the ball up on the wing you're like he could get the ball into the box and shoot from here yeah I'm I'm and not many I don't see I don't see whatever I end up with I actually don't don't see me not captaining isach in game we one I think that will be my captain regardless I think I'm there now I think yeah I think he is yeah I think he's the best option for the week and it's an opportunity to take it it's an opportunity where I think a lot of people are just going to a lot of people are going to Captain Salah as well so there is there is definitely an opportunity there as well I quite like Saka too if if we're pretty sure he's starting yeah um so there are a few options he's not Far and Away stand out but he's probably the I say safest not in terms of like relative risk but in terms of like he's going to play he'll he'll play n they're playing home promoted side isn't it so it's like okay yeah I quite like away promote just go big Dom T night let everyone else have their captains Friday Saturday Sunday let them have

under the radar and and go from there sound good sounds great looking forward to it good stuff uh this is obviously Live on YouTube so there is a YouTube chat I'll be keeping an eye on that but uh we're mainly just going to have a love in really aren't we we're just going to say yeah the chat's probably just going to hate us so ignore that quite a lot it'll just be every time we talk positively but you know normal Tottenham nor to jobs but well good oh so Wendy you're playing FPL again this year absolutely yeah uh last year um I was a probably below average uh I think I used to be quite good at FPL and then everyone else started playing it and I realized I wasn't actually that good as it turned out um I think we're all facing that mate I think that's a problem for everybody nowadays too many good players these days yeah and um I always say it but we have new people each year to do this but there's a really really competitive FPL league in your world I don't know what's there about 800 people or something in your league and it does if you're not probably top couple of hundred in in your pod League you you ain't getting in it's a really busy busy place so if anyone looking for a Tottenham home to to be and are interested in FPL then I always recommend the uh extrange Discord yeah absolutely so our patreon has a a Discord behind the pay wall and there's a FPL Channel which gets a lot of activity um and let you say some very good players in there um tough competition very tough Nathan are we we pulling you into the dark side this season not this season not this season it's um I I mean I daav with football manager which is something that I've sort of written off on the same grounds as like I already spend enough time thinking analyzing football and then I I did play football manager for a bit and I've sort of already lost the ball there so it's I guess now I can say it's not completely out the picture that I would play fbl in in in the future but but basically I've already I'm already spending all my time watching football as it is we are one we're one pod closer to Nathan playing FB again we one pod closer yeah exactly exactly and we'll take the hot takes that'll do us that's good so uh if you do enjoy the content on the channel this season then make sure you drop a uh drop a like on the video and hit subscribe if you want to see more and if you're

full of schedule for next week I can't I just can't get the time next time next time next time um let's talk Tottenham let's just get straight into it people are already saying in the chat we want to go we want bergal propaganda we want we want porro propaganda we want we want it all so should we start with Pedro start with Pedro is he going to be the best defender in FPL this season the yeah Trent and vardal probably that I mean most people can potentially have two of those perro is slightly cheaper than them Trent is the most expensive but of the three sort of Premium Defenders out there they're the ones that people are looking at the moment is uh Tren vard on parro I guess what we're saying it's going to be competing uh for minutes with Bradley and gardio might not be playing much in the wide areas this season with their change of wide Winger profile at city so I guess that means that poru is definitely in contention for best defender I mean Nathan you you had a take on parro when no to no no idea what you're referring under the bus like we didn't think that he could defend defend yeah yeah and now how do you feel uh embarrassed um no uh no with with you know all respect to tooro he's he's come on leaps of bounds defensively I think um and been able to get in his attacking and creative upside um yeah he's really really impressed me I think that like um he's especially improved in his like one V one defensive capability um uh which again huge development but like the ball will still go over his head at the back post um quite a bit that's still there it's not like he's just completely fix perfect uh you know right-sided Defender but he's improving where he realistically can and maybe the more positional stuff and physical stuff will will keep coming on are the friendlies are the friendlies like something that we would expect to continue like his positioning cuz he just looks like a just like a marauding free roll lunatic when he turn when he pops up on sort of like the left half space outside the box is is I I don't think we're going to expect to see that too much right you know obviously we're still just building up well I say you say well but you know we're still we're still not full strength in in friendlies and we're not there are players still to come back in this is the thing about por though isn't it like in FPL defender in reality deep playing playmaker right winger number 10 sometimes in preseason who's been number nine he is all over the pitch in the best possible way he's he's the heartbeat of the team a lot of the time he's helping set the tempo and he's also getting on the end of things and he's a brilliant finisher and it seems like we've discovered a way of getting him into the box more so he can put that finishing to the test and I am very excited about that Prospect I do I wonder a little bit as well where obviously kulesi may be a little bit out of his way than he potentially would have been like a lot of times he was almost playing at that right 10 wasn't he type space and you know when he would come in so whereas maybe there's a bit more credit I do also think when s plays also is quite helpful for for parro and that they do interchange really really well in the dve tailing but like he had 53 shots last season that's quite a lot for a defender in it the only thing stopping him from being the top scoring defender in the game will be if Spurs don't get their defensive game together and he doesn't get the clean sheets because I think attacking output wise he's got it he's got everything he's got crossing shooting probably some set pieces he's got a lot but defensively we were quite inconsistent last year to say the least yeah and you know I would say in preseason it's hard to judge our defense because essentially they haven't been there you've had hor and then three other players who won't start so tough tough to judge off the back of that but we've looked pretty open like we were last season um you know if if we if we sign a player uh for the final third that can retain possession a little more or if koseski plays through the middle as number nine and he retains possession a bit more the ball should come back at us a bit less which will help porro and us more generally but yeah we're quite an open side we're bretty gung-ho do we think that I mean do we do we think that in in some ways though a second season now we'll just we'll just get some natural Improvement we'll just get some natural improvement from it right I don't think I don't think we're sitting here thinking that we're going to defend exactly the same way and concede as many chances as we did last year obviously I mean in last year we have to consider that we did have significant injuries to to VAV and to doggy and you know we obviously had the Romero suspension I mean that Chelsea game basically flipped our season upside down or like in in instantly um and so surely surely it gets a bit better I mean it doesn't even if it's not a huge huge Improvement like just even like a 10 10 15% Improvement on our on our defensive numbers would be huge for yeah for for the opportunity to keep clean seats at least I think it was koseski in an interview with aliser gold who said that preseason training has been a bit different to last year that you can already tell that it's kind of gone up a notch and what he meant by that is the level of detail it's not the intensity it's the detail so we've got this kind of um set of overarching principles of anible uh that the players know Now inverted fullbacks being a large part of it and now it's about okay here's where you are on the pitch but here's I want you to do with the ball and here's how I want you to recover when you lose it um and I think that is kind of what you're getting at there Adam it's like you take on what we learned last year to the next level you've probably cleared out some of the players that aren't quite there with with what he's trying to do and is that yeah but know Emon ra still there he'll be gone there there are plenty of others um and yeah hopefully take it on another stage and and progress as a team and that's the dream isn't it that's what we're all hoping for I just think it's it's only got to benefit you when you know a new manager comes in and you know maybe you're going to see the similar thing with Liverpool but a new manager comes in and then they're trying to explain to the team how they're going to set up and looking at you're looking at scenarios where you want your players to be and what I'm guessing last season he would have had to use scenarios from I don't know maybe his time at Celtic and maybe his time in the past whereas now he can look back at specific things that he did with his team in a Tottenham shirt and say look you were here not like I don't know not like Celtic right back was here you should be here right we can use our own players and then then the players can at least relate to it and understand exactly what they're being told to do which surely must be better yeah I that makes a little sense yeah I yeah so you know I'm I'm expecting our defensive numbers to improve I'm expecting us to be I'm still not 100% sure on set Pieces Just because just cuz I just think as a as a team we're small and just really from a heading perspective we just seem really weak at defensive headers I don't know why that is unless it is just guy Nathan this is this is it this is tell me why Nathan uh I think good I I I had it differently but I there was some some writing from uh uh turns out he's an Arsenal fan but uh a set pieces uh expert Who I Really respect uh did a big big deep dive into our defensive set pieces and the story of over the season where we started off okay we had a bit in the Middle where we conceded a few and that's when we started to tweak things and change things around and really we started with a good setup and probably get got a bit too frightened um and probably should have just stuck with um stuck with what we had and just asked a bit more from Vicario and did some specialist training on working on protecting Vicario or Vicario protecting himself more to the point and I think then at the end of the season uh like I'm talking like last three four games uh we got back on track went back to how we were doing things in the early season vicario's been lifting weights um so some decent signs there but like yeah we could do a lot you know arguably in open play but if the set pieces are still like they were statistically over the course of the last season then then don't expect too many clean sheets but then to be honest in terms of like what I think we'll achieve in open Play I was hoping there would be signs in preseason that we would would change our buildup shape a bit so we kept an extra player behind the ball or staggered the players we keep behind the ball a little differently and there hasn't been any sign of that um we haven't uh really improved our defensive person outside of Jed Spence becoming another option um so we are I mean I think Jen's done better at right center back uh in preseason then then he did at left so okay deusen's improved us there in ter terms of defensive depth but I and I accept the general position okay second season more granular detail you know the general momentum going into season two but there are still considerable highlevel uh defensive frail that start with how we act in possession and how we just throw players forwards take risk on the ball all stuff that by the way I love and I'm glad for but from an FB perspective uh we're a few transfers away and they could be attacking transfers but ones that allow us to keep the ball when we send it forward you know um wear a few transfers away from me saying yeah I think we're going to be significantly better defensively than we were last season well let's still transfers then um you you too did a brilliant pod for anyone again who wants to check that out on the expence YouTube Just Around it's actually quite difficult in terms of the changing uh just changing players with the number of foreign players we've got the demands we have on terms of Association trained Club trained and the like um which is probably you know partly while we're linked mainly to people that are in this Premier League already you know um uh and obviously salanki is the link up front at the moment seems to be sanki more than say Tony in that world does that make any difference even defensively in terms of the ability of having someone that can hold up I think so I think so like I said so you know apart from the fact that we put a lot of players forward apart from the fact that an wants his players to take risks Under Pressure um we send the ball for that we send the ball forward fast into players who so last season you would say a front line of maybe sun uh well you'd say Sun at Center forwards koseski on the right verer on the left in the second half of the season um who weren't really keeping the ball if it's Brenan Johnson worse for keeping the ball in the front line you know and so the ball goes forward quick the ball comes back quick row I think sanki would be an upgrade in our our Hold Up play not that richardon is terrible um but sanki didn't miss a single game last season and that would be significant you know um so yeah I do think salanki would improve Spurs defensively and also is another big guy or not another big guy is a big guy to start um for defensive set pieces so yeah I do think that that sanki might create two or three clean sheets over the course of the Season genuinely yeah that's a good point um the sort of injured people you just mentioned michis obviously we've got destiny as well in that sense not featured in preseason so far any news on them of do we think they're fit for start of season do we not like UD DOI is back in training uh and Rison is not far behind I would highly doubt that Richardson will start the season I think he'll need to get back up to speed on some time also oogi had a massive injury like long layoff so we don't know how long he'll take to get back up to speed um the difference I suppose actually I was going to say the difference is that we don't have cover at left back so doggy would kind of come back in but that's not necessarily true and also if ral's out he's got a dilemma does he play koseski through the middle does he play son through the middle um yeah it's tough I think I wouldn't Bank on either of them starting the season probably wouldn't Bank on either them playing the first two games uh maybe doggy makes the Everton game a doubt charison does keep an eye on who Do's price I wouldn't be surprised if his goals jumped up a little bit second season it's just it's just the beauty for FPL is the first two fixtures yeah like like after that new after that it's Newcastle away North London Derby so like that that Leicester Everton game if we're looking to attack is is it's that and does does make me think again just on parro just on on the propaganda side of it if say for example plays safe with Davies as that person there it almost suggests even more we might see it you know parro as the person that's used as the attacking sort of outy across those back three I'd be surprised if he risk vaner van like straight in and say hey go out there and do those kind of running and get an early injury it just that feels scary I agree I completely agree I think Davis Spence or gray an outside shout I think I would have all three of those ahead of vanen in my left back options in newor absence yeah Spencer's done well Spence's done really well yeah really impressive like um there's still speculation that he might leave but I think we know now that the club have been impressed by his attitude and his application in preseason um brilliant Ball Carrier again like real real offensive threat um doesn't get as many shots as porro but gets to the by line more um because of his driving runs also like moves inside plenty with the ball with and without the ball so he should find himself in the Box he just hasn't sort of uh got the same reputation for getting shots away but yeah really good player in front of them bis how important Puma because we got 26 starts out of him last season now some of that was self-inflicted that we didn't get as many starts out of him but a third of the Season without him last season it's big numbers for me we spoke about him on the Pod this week and I made the perhaps slightly grandiose comment that uh I think he's our most important player um because there's no backup there's no no one close to his quality in terms of what he can do um I think he's brilliant I think he's really underappreciated among Spurs fans he definitely had a bit of a drop off and I think it came around his sending off and disciplinary issues I think he lost confidence off the back of that then he went away to the African Cup of Nations um yeah and there there was a period where he didn't look the same player came back really strong at the end of the season in my opinion and I think he's fantastic and so important to what we do both defensively and with the ball as well you know buildup play comes through him and if it doesn't come through him he's dragging two players away it did feel like it did feel like last season when we played so when we had the preseason last season we would see the likes of skip obviously was one of them but paps are mainly like crashing into the box and in sort of late run basically um to hit that back post we've even seen that this season already in preseason and it just that wasn't available to him when when hyberg was there trying to protect the back four and he had to come in back in and help out so you know hopefully that gives whoever the the 810s are going to be you know the license to be able to actually you know join that join that attack a bit stronger um yeah so that's good that's good the more minutes we can get out of him the better at the moment I mean I guess people are going to ask whether whether someone like Archie gray could play in there as well as a as a backup if needed I mean that might be a question actually so you mentioned Archie gray potentially on left back cover you know obviously we've got por at right back and basuma defensive mid where does where does gray sit in all this for this season from in your guys opinion I think he is um student just yeah a student a student first of all that's right um I don't know where the club want to get a minutes of fullback get a minutes of six get a minutes of eight or just sort of see what happens um I've got some some tactical concerns over him playing six uh in the uh short medium-term future to be honest and I would say on basuma in fact because of that like um I mean he's not an FBO pick he ain't going to get goals and assists but uh if basuma is out for a lengthy period of time sell all your Spurs players because we're in trouble that's that's my peruma tip we need this we do need him we do need him we've got another young lad though not just gray people are very interested because he's 4.5 million as cheap as a midfielder can be enables you you know to have that sort of like eight attacker if you can find one that has minutes currently the most owned 4.5 midfielder is Harry Winks but there's a man he is virtually a man the way that he plays in in in bergville as a Spurs fan I'm excited about bergall as a Spurs fan uh I love that he's in the squad I think that he can take minut minutes um but from an F perspective he's he's not guaranteed those minutes by some way I think two years time yeah two years time we're talking three years time you've got a midfielder who's going to score goals and he's going to be undeniable in terms of minutes but this season I wouldn't I wouldn't expect too many minutes from bergall he's going to be playing in Europa League if he's going to be playing I think yeah that's the thing that's the thing and it's not anything to do with the level of ability he has it's all about the competition it's all about the number of players who play the same role or a slightly variation of the role um and when you look at our transfer targets you know we're clearly trying to sign another midfielder it seems like we're trying to sign another number eight we wanted K Conor gallago been linked with Jacob Ramsey um so he could go even further down the pecking order but super impressive in preseason creative really Saucy tries things all the time like wants to commit players um yeah good good ball striking just good good young player very very talented young player but I think I agree with Nathan that he'll mainly be a Europa League starter and Premier League sub now that could be useful as a 4.5 that if if three or four games of the Season he's had a couple of sub appearances and he's doing things not the worst shout you know you're not going to fill your team with Spurs players at all like you you might have porro maybe you have one other Spurs player I probably wouldn't so the options there for for bergville as your fifth midfielder if he starts looking handy Off the Bench yeah and I guess the minutes probably the one that I sort of felt watching the weekend as the minutes that he could eat into a little bit is probably Madison um he gets so Madison I feel like this feels like had a lot of injury last season came back doesn't play a lot of 9s albeit last couple of games you did start to play him we've got him come back then they start of the season and not played a huge number of minutes again lots of s of 45s and so forth um and it feels like a fan base is down on him um there is some changes within FPL to the bonus system which we did a PO on that a few weeks ago and it basically he's like the big winner really without changing position or anything like that you know HS for Arsenal and Madison are like the the biggest winners you know for for the changes around that can you can you sorry I know you've already done content on this and you got repeating I'm curious can you can you do the the quick overview on that for me so basically I I think the easiest way to describe it to someone is is that the bonus points had some really complicated metrics of just different things that someone would do in a game um that didn't necessarily be the same as say we're watching a football game and the person that turns up on the TV when Gary Neville says his man of the match is someone very different to who got the most bonus and I feel like because you know it's a really popular game they've tried to make it slightly more than that so Defenders now lose points from their bonus if they concede which they didn't before so you could concede seven goals it wouldn't wouldn't impact your abil yeah yeah yeah um uh but now goals are a big big currency um you know if you don't clean you're a Defender you won't and that that negatively affects parro um because you know last season he was able to get bonus so like the 4-2 against Brighton because he got an assist at the end he got two bonus points and it was like we just conceded four goals mate you know um but those sort of things won't happen anymore but what you have now got is shots on target get you more and getting fouled um and used to lose points because he can be quite petulent but also people kick him a lot he is a foul magnet big time Big Time he is a massive foul magnet so if we thought that m's on set pieces and he's playing 90 minutes all the time he's fantastic the big question the reason why no one's really looking at the moment is everyone's not sure on the minutes and then you've got kulesi and Brennan who are a million cheaper or you stretch up the Sun so m um is a bit of a forgotten man in FPL um how do you feel I I'm confused for Spurs fans are so down on Madison right now to be honest I think so there's this narrative that predates in being Spurs there this Lester eara narrative that like oh for a third of the Season he's brilliant and then he's injured and then he's rubbish or whatever I don't really buy into that I think that was a Leicester problem rather than the James Madison problem um whereas I think he had an unlucky injury in the midseason this time and he clearly wasn't fit when he came back I don't know How likely is I mean obviously he's he's getting on a little bit now as a player so maybe he you know maybe you're expecting that injury to keep happening but uh I think if he doesn't get injured he is um a goals and assists monster from Midfield the the thing is now obviously we've been linked to the likes of E earlier in the window du uh players who can play wide a bit but also compete for melison so if we make a big we if we make the E signing okay now Madison is sharing his minutes in the league but in my opinion as it is bergville isn't going to take that many minutes from Madison Koski isn't going to take that many minutes from Madison um so I think Madison is someone who is worth considering uh at least for like runs if he's not picking up long-term injuries I mean there's there's a you know people there is a saying that like he's until he's injured he's he's not injured right he's fit right so yeah that's it I think I think we just need to maybe just treat him as Fit until he is injured and then move on and for anyone who wants to lean into playing against former clubs like he hasn't played against Leicester yet has he so he has not like first game back at back at King Power could be then home to Everton yeah I mean it is it definitely is interesting with m and it's it's a good price point it's probably the funny thing is is that I think most Spurs fans are sort of aware of the a links and um um but I never see anybody outside of the Spurs Circle he's those like it's like it's completely new to them that they don't see it actually he's in everyone's team at Palace he's in everyone's team he's he's cheaper than Madison he's on penalties and all those type of things um H Nathan you got you got itk that you can say no no no no no I'm just thinking like like if you've got if you got e on your team now and he moves from Palace to Spurs you're in a tricky situation if he moves like after the after the season starts because I mean as a brilliant brilliant player obviously but is he going to play wide is he going to play 10 is he like keeping Madison just completely out the team or or is he a player who for the first half of the season is brought in to play a game wide starts a game on the bench comes off as an impact sub gets a few a running games on the right because Spurs didn't buy a right winger and that affects his ability to get goals things like that lot of question marks about about is bringing in a lot of City have got room because Alvarez has gone today as well so you know we know that teams that that as has been linked to is City and us so that will um get e at your teams get a at your teams I think we got we got 10 days we got 10 days to work it out okay but yeah we can yeah we we'll we'll move him if we need to but mad h on Mad h on M lukewarm um lukewarm so then we got the front fre then we got the front free and it's like even what position they're in and so forth so one is a lot more more expensive than the others in the and the Sun is 10 million the other two are 6 and a half you know if you look at if you look at numbers last season you know Brennan Brennan got 10 XG compared to compared to Suns 12 like not a huge amount of number in it you know is you know the expected numbers for Brennan are are real good how did he do in terms of points last season Brenan he did okay I mean he only started 23 games didn't he so the problem is is a lot of people didn't pick in because you never really knew what was the situation with him was he the first choice right winger or not kulesi was always there um so good spurts was he good for like a run of six seven games and then get him out or also because of again he could benefit from the bonus Parts but players that play in Midfield cuz he's a midfielder yeah is um and that don't do a lot the the Wingery type guys they they're useless for B bonus the Bens and the Brennan of those type of guys where they're really he's a poacher they're poaches you know what I mean and those ones is they're good for goals they get the fivepoint goals because they're a midfielder but they don't they don't get that and and I also think you know sometimes a lot of times with Brennan is that and we've seen it in preseason again people are quite hard on it because quite often all of this good works off the ball like essentially and the the bit that works is the bit of him poking the ball in the net or getting the ball across when needed to um are making those ones do you I guess if we buy a number nine the big question is does koseski go back to right wing and or they start sharing it you know or is Brennan now just it and koseski would be the reserve number nine and if we don't get one is coolu the number nine then who's the better one and are his son worth the money to just go up because he's got penalties and his son there's a lot there yeah a lot and I think too many variables to make decisions on Spurs forwards right now to be honest and so I would be avoiding all of them um unless we sign salanki in which case I'll sign salanki I'll buy salanki for sure because with Rison being injured sank will start um son so I think son is a brilliant player uh back into the last season he played through the middle and I was finding myself so frustrated by him and it wasn't fair for me to be frustrated by him because he didn't choose to play through the middle and he was doing his best for the team but I didn't like the way we played when some was through the middle because the ball just bounces back off him put him wide and you know what Nathan was saying earlier about ball retention and you know you're able to hold to the ball more and that helped you defensively I think son's ball retention out wide is fine I think it's good because he cuts me to run on to he stands up a Defender and you hold on to the ball and maybe he passes it back or maybe he whips it across goal and Johnson's there at back post to tap it in I think son's ball retention through the middle is terrible the ball bounces off his ankles he's chasing down his first touch it doesn't work I want son wide left every game every game is fit and I want him to rotated a fair amount because he's quite an old man now bless him but generally I want him play when he's playing I want him on the left through the middle I want ralis or salanki if we sign him or koseski and that's fine on the right I'm confused about what we're going do um I've had to retrain myself somewhat with Johnson I think Johnson's a good player I think Johnson is um very skilled at a few things and because he's not highly skilled at some of the other things I like my Winger to do I kind of have to tell myself that that's fine that he's just really skilled at those few things um but those things are quite good when it comes to fpl points like he is brilliant at timing a run and getting at the back post between the sticks and putting in putting him in there um I don't think we've had a better Winger at hitting the back post than brandan Johnson In My Time supporting spur I don't recall any others that have come close that's a that's a hard skill to master and he's mastered it um so that's good but do I want Johnson starting every game no I don't I don't I don't want Johnson starting every game I want him starting some games and coming off the bench and others and terrorizing Defenders who have got tied legs um but do I think Kev is the alternative he hasn't played out wide in preseason for more than about 10 or 15 minutes he's Midfield or up front so maybe we'll sign a Winger maybe the Netto link will finally come to fruition we side Pedro Netto and he'll be our right winger a lot um but yeah there's too many variables it's too confusing and unless son starts incredibly hot then I'm leading Spurs attacking our front line in reality and our forward and midfielders in the game alone yeah I'm just wondering how kiski is gonna because kesi doesn't fit that profile that an wants on that right hand side anymore it doesn't doesn't quite work the same the same way as we had it under under Conte right so um but he's the only one that can play out there really isn't he I mean would you would you would you force maybe even like Jed Spence up there or would you just put Jed Spence at right back and force porro up there um buy someone you gotta buy someone if you don't like it yeah yeah I think so okay see yeah keski was definitely the the first choice right winger for most of last season Johnson got a couple of runs um off the back of being good Off the Bench and then kosi is good Off the Bench and it's like oh maybe it's not either one good player it's coming off the bench that's the helpful thing right uh but it seems like uh preseason uh keski is no longer uh considered a a right winger we're exploring him as a nine option we're exploring him in Midfield um not to say that he won't get any rightwing minutes but but he isn't um he isn't the priority player there um and BR Johnson's been starting there PR my hope is oh my goodness my hope is that Brenan Johnson is not our starting right we not out of a deep hatred for Brennan Johnson because Spurs need the profile of a player to come in and reliably beat their man get to the by line Low cross goals and assists and if we bring in a play like that um then then all of our forwards start to become interesting options and might in my opinion and manison more so right um but then at the same time if Brenan Johnson is starting games he will get goals and assists I'll find it personally frustrating but he might still be a decent FBO because he'll get goals and assists just not of the style that I that I want and reliably as I want um but definitely definitely don't expect keski to be starting games I think yeah once the once the nine experiment over you don't see it it's koseski that goes back to the right um there's a chance that kosi be comes our second choice number nine um and therefore gets a run of games at number nine if we sell richison or even if we keep richison I guess um in which case yeah he might good for a couple of goals but I think that he's going to be in and out of the game useful to Spurs but not useful to an fbl Squad and we got Europa again so it's only those two really out there is it yeah you'd expect sun gets the rest for Europa and Teo comes in I think the only POS what what you when day around sun and you know you want to see him left kind of feel like an must want must want that too otherwise why would he have done what he had done with keski yeah yeah I think you're right and we've not seen much of s the middle in um preseason when the opportunity's been there he's mainly played through the left on the first game he played up top and then not since then yeah I think yeah which I think I think do hint towards an wanting him wide left also um we've mostly been linked with right sided Wingers yes and I think that also hints towards him wanting son on the left and the fact that we signed verer similar profile is to son is uh probably implies that those two are the kind of yeah the the First Choice and then the rotation option I mean Netto can do both can't he as well so there there yeah yeah he can play Both Sides he I mean I think he would probably play mostly right side for us but he certainly could play left side yeah and we think I mean it does sound everything seems like transfer wise look Spurs fans already we we're now panicking that we're not getting anyone this is nothing's happening it's all it's all doom and gloom despite the fact that nobody's got anybody um that's you know here neither here nor there we've got a lot of players still to move out I feel like to be able to just get the squad room to be able to do it and someone you know said did a really good video that showed that um but it does seem like the additions it feels to me like two from four from salanki Tony ESS and Netto really that seems to be which doesn't sound quite as cool as I'd like do you know what I mean I want to hear someone that that's from another League I don't know it that na told us about it um yeah I saw sort of links with Forest earlier to Santiago imz and stuff and I was like oh can we have someone like him like do that sort of stuff and in that world but um it does feel like we're looking to strengthen first team from players with Premier League experience to go with a youth that we've got yeah I've I've been the guy banging the drum about about scouting other leagues and and not overpaying for Premier League players for the last you know five years or whatever but in that time the premier league has really gone up a level compared to its competitors with with the mainly with the coaching talent in the league but also for financial reasons too and so Premier proven is uh is is you know 10% more significant than it was just a few years ago and if Spurs want players to affect the first 11 then you're probably going to want to bring in a premier League existing player and and and pay over the odds for it right so we got question just just got a question uh just want to rank our top three Spurs attackers in order where would you go if you had to put one of them in I mean if money's no issue I think I'd pick son still uh and then medicine and then probably Johnson Madison over the over kouu and Brenan yes yeah just be like you said bonus points set pieces uh also I think he's brilliant I really rate Madison I think he's an excellent player I think um he like again he dipped last year he he lost confidence in his body for whatever reason after injury and didn't look himself at all hence he wasn't in the Euro Squad um but already in preseason I think he's kind of looking back to his normal self got a bit of swagger back he's really good really good uh What would your top three be uh number one is whoever plays number nine for us basically because everything we've said about like SP Spurs can't keep a defensive sheet right it's like a clean sheet sorry defensively um we churn out the chances for for our number nine we absolutely put them on the plate so whether it's rison's fit for a running games whether we bring in to lanky whether sun moves back to being number nine even if it's koseski getting running games at number nine whoever's in that role is is going to get goals um and a couple of assists because that is the strength of the team is is open Play Chance creation if we bring in sanki and a new right winger who can beat their man oh my goodness that's that's that's that's a that's overall number one pick like they're going to they're going to absolutely Beast yeah so um and then and then I'm saying you know Madison then I'm saying I look at look at Johnson's price and things like that and we said attacking because parro for me is stand out if you're doing the whole team yes yeah same yeah yeah um Mikey Mo has not been priced up no price I suppose and signed contract yet whatever and all that stuff so they've not put him in the game the put I mean we don't know what he's coming in but I'm assuming if he comes in it's like 4.5 or 5.0 that it won't be it definitely won't be more than that we it's only right we as we only have y on occasionally that we have some kind of predictions so Mary more the season I think the only prediction you can make is that uh he will get a good number of minutes this year because he's part of the first team squad now and that seems absurd to be saying about a 16y old but it's true he's he's a first team squad member I think he'll probably pay play like maybe 500 minutes and so I don't think that makes him a viable FPL option however if he is at some point coming off the bench a bit like what I said about bergell earlier he can he can do things in a productive attacking Spurs side he's more than capable of creating especially against tied legs physically he's he's not 16 he's absurd he's another freak um so yeah I I I would steer clear of more for now um but later in the season if he's getting regular cameos then sure fill up your your last Midfield slot with Mikey Moore I'm really interested to see how good these how good this Europa League side is going to look like right cuz it feels like it feels like this is where they're all going to be right so drusian is going to play and Spence is definitely going to play you know Ben Davis probably plays because Ben Davis is Ben Davis but you know you know Archie gray might play you know in in there as well bergal Mikey Moore you can play Kulu in there verer will get minutes in there as well I mean that's that's quite a lot of energy quite a lot of good quality players that we're talking about getting minutes in the Premier League the back end of the season might be where we see more of I obviously it depends on how far we go in the Europa League um but yeah no that's promising definitely promising yes and spent getting minutes is good news for anyone looking to pick por because it means he gets arrest and and and sharing the burd in a bit I think yeah definitely definitely definitely definitely good good good good I mean there's no way I'm not having part my T game definitely there at the moment like I do see there's some good 10 there's some really good 10 million plan players you Sun yeah you know foden's just under 9.5 Palm's just over 10.5 sacka is there at 10 salah's a bit more most people have got kind of one of those in their team um son's got the best first two fixtures really effectively and he's the only one of those that's you know salah's obviously a bit more expensive but the 10 he's the only one that's had a preseason effectively Palmer saac and foden haven't um which it it it draws me it draws me in a lot it draws me in a lot um for it but yeah I do wonder you know the likes of if Koski or Brennan suddenly like like Koski does look like he gots a number nine start the season it's like well you can have him and then it gets you to afford Salah quite easily and it's like H it's making me more Madison like it's making me more hot yeah really because a lot of things that I've been tinkering around with either one with either Harland or Salah so for example let's say I go with Salah uh sorry with Harland and no Salah I've been going for son which means I can't get Trent so if I drop that down to a Madison like Trent just is immediately available and that feels really interesting um just little little tweaks like that make and you know you don't just get Trent out that you get more out of that as well you get another probably million million quid that you can spend elsewhere as well it's just I mean I'll have to have a look how that looks but I was I was keen on Madison as soon as the pricing came out I was really keen on Madison and then everything called off and I think that might have been due to due to just noise around Madison from Spurs and from and from the fact that FPL Community wer w't really talking about him but they they tend to not talk about Spurs anyway so uh there is that but I needed this today I needed this today actually if I end up if I end up with game one mad I game one Madison Captain against Lester love that love that you love that love that I love ding these carrots you know what I mean he does so Baker does is known full well that on next Friday when we are at Fantasy Football Fest when the deadline hits I'll have had half a dozen beers and a couple of fire that Madison that Madison captaincy is well on the table by then that carrot is getting chopped he does do he does do this what what was the last time you what was the last time you did it I did it for vario mate iio he got and he got 24 points so it's sometimes it works I did it for KD B before that and that didn't work out too well yeah fun but he well it's a pleasure boys absolutely absolutely and um I hear your you're you're plotting against me Baker well well I've offered the services we we we always you know have you two lovely people but you are a trio and uh the the third member bardy I heard on a pod that you said that you know bardy played all season last season sort of cracks on of it and I was like I help him is Mission beat windy Mission beat windy so uh I've offered to uh uh support look you know there's no way like immediately you know B is way way too headstrong to to let me sort of like tell him what to do as such but maybe if I can try and push him a little in a few directions that hopefully we just imagine as soon as you say oh yeah Gabrielle's a good pick in defense he be like no no go abely interested give him some uh punishing Antonio con style homework like yes like detailed videos that he has to watch or some definitely real deep reading with a lot of numbers Taskmaster manager on him yeah be in we'll see how he gets on he's gonna race up the sidekicks League um he's taking it this season sounds good sounds good well thank you very much guys for coming and joining us again um thank you to everyone in the chat there is one final question that I am going to ask um who do we think the Box crashing eight will be I mean does it is it just going to be S is there is there any competition for him on that on that right side significant competition for him what do you think Nathan um the fullbacks the fullbacks will be the Box crashes and dead wow yeah so porro basically more just more porro more por more por give more poranda love it you read you read that off the chat earlier didn't you poranda that's it love it um cool we'll leave it there Wendy Nathan thanks for joining us as always uh Wendy best of luck with FPL this season seeing as you're against Baker and bardy uh combined Nathan as I say one pod closer we're one pod closer so but we may get you next time but uh yeah until next time thanks very much again for for coming on and you know have a good season on your pod again to everyone if you haven't checked out the extra inch and

are almost there almost there almost there thanks look guys cheers guys Cheers Cheers [Music],9905
25,fplbanger,vaW7z3eEUlQ,Triple Captain Haaland is a perfectly logical choice this week  #fpl,2024-08-23T09:35:51Z,is to look at a single game week for triple captaincy and so the feeling and this isn't just team at home yeah Holland against how how much Holland against a promoted team at home no threat of Champions League rotation no issues about minutes you know he's fit he'll play will you get a better chance than this later in the season and a lot of people feel it's worth going for this week we both don't have Holland so this is hard to talk about without bias but you know pretend S I think if you can do it that' be great but I think it's one of those things where a lot of people have the idea but they're not actually going to do it you know I don't think all you guys really got the backbone to do it but the idea the concept of fresh Harland early in the season and um I spoke last week you know you tend to see less clean sheets at the start defenses not so organized at home against a promoted team at,184
26,fplbanger,L2UCn85HcV4,FPL GW2 TEAM REVEAL : RICO IN! - FPL Tips 2024/25,2024-08-22T09:24:37Z,oh this thing hello everyone and welcome back to the FL Banger show my name is Sila and something a little different we're doing a team reveal this week ahead of game week two I thought I'd just sort of run through my team and I'm sure I'm facing some very common issues to the rest of the people watching the stream quick recap of what happened last week 7 turn points decent start very happy with this I mean you can't ask much more than that um didn't go with Holland as you can tell that's the bigger Mission here and because no Holland I had Saka I had Havard I had Salah I had well I had son and salanki which I thought would be amazing but very happy with this score captaincy you can't uh worry too much about it a lot of I got a lot of comments about how should have Captain Salah and um I'm not too concerned about that simply because I think isach was the right pick given the fixture at home Newcastle against uh Southampton it just didn't work out you know because the red card came so early you can't do anything about that and I I won't lose too much sleep about it but if you went for Salah great I mean brilliant Captain uh great performance slow first half but picked up a lot more the second half and I think if you own Salah jota Trent you're in good stad I guess that kind of takes us to the other Liverpool player in this team and that's jell K Quanza we spoke about it on the Pod earlier this week and even to be fair in the previews we weren't convinced by K Quanza we but we we sort of appreciated the fact that he was first choice preseason and we were hoping he would keep his place and you know decision making process-wise I don't think we were so far off the mark he did start the first game you can't plan for the fact that he might lose all his duels and then get subbed off at halim it's just one of those things but it's been a problem right because uh if you have Quanza you've taken a minus well 0.1 drop already in the first week and that's the last thing you want to do because losing 0.1 at this stage is effectively the same as losing 0.5 and the reason for that is because we have no assets who you want to buy who are 0.1 cheaper so you effectively now need to spend half a million to replace Quanza or you got to go down to a 4 million Defender so that's an issue and it's something I'll touch on in my team selection for game week 2 so Quant a problem and definitely those who paid the extra of a trend fair play I think you were spot on uh he looks great new system seems to be working for him I'm very jealous of trend owners I thought quite I was quite fortunate to get away without any assists because he was very attacking setting up a lot of chances in fact it's his pass that ultimately created the Breakthrough in the first place so bit of worries there um happy with porro I I'm quietly confident he'll be fit uh saw videos of him walking after the incident where he came off injured at the end of the match uh seems to be quite a beat on social media and so on so I'm hoping it's nothing too serious and he'll be fit for Everton if he is I think um you just need only look at some of his heat Maps most advanced Spurs attacker after sank and he's not even an attacker right he's a right back he was more advanced than Brandon Johnson I think good good asset to keep I'm very happy with B I think I will hold him for quite a while and I think at 5.5 yes Spurs still very spursy didn't keep a clean but I'm prepared to uh see how the next few games go because P's attacking threat is just that big sun and sanki very disappointed I think more so in Sun than sanki if you watch the game you'd have seen sank was quite involved it's really positive that he played 90 minutes from the off and I thought he had some decent half chances nothing that you would expect him to score but good movement um and I think put in a good shift and I'm happy to keep because I think a 7.5 million starting attacker for a uh an an team which always tries to play on the front foot I think that's a good asset to have Sun I'm quite concerned about I must say as I wonder why I went for sun why did I go for sun I think we discussed this a bit on the po but I I really didn't I lost confidence in the idea of 5.5 million mids as we got closer to the deadline and that sort of goes against a lot of things I said in the preseason that we've got so many budget mids but as we got closer it just felt a lot of these guys came with a lot of flags un certainties issues over minutes even we saw the best pick I would have said would have been Smith row he didn't even play 90 this week came off at 60 had less attacking threat than Andreas Pereira and that's not ideal and Fulmer signing apparently trying to sign more attackers now which is worrying for me I think and then you look at Palace taii kamada came off early also 5.5 million if you look at Southampton I wasn't impressed at how they played against Newcastle uh failing to score against 10 men they played against 10 men for almost 70 minutes and they still couldn't score that's not a great sign so that pushes me off guys like B and years and Armstrong and so I all that you know taking that all into consideration I went for a big 10 million midfielder like sun well I thought okay so that's that's a security that's what I'm paying for that's why I don't have harand because I can have Saka Salah and sun and Sun just didn't show up I mean Spurs were poor uh but even in the first half where they were dominating and they were running everything son had a couple of dribbles I think he had some good dribbles and got into some good positions but just no end product I think not. 03 XG which is just you're not paying 10 million for that so I think I'll give son Everton but out of this group of Spurs and Newcastle players I think he's the one who's most likely to go and looking ahead to game week three I think Brian and bore is a easy replacement here um 7.5 so not cheap but looks like he's going to be on pen looks like he's going to be playing up top for brenford I think with Tony leaving suu and bomo should release a lot more cash and that allows me to perhaps look at maybe upgrading one of my Defenders to Trent which is kind of the long-term plan um isak very solid I I think happy to hold I glad that he got a return I think uh you can't read too much into that game Lewis Hall good Five Points uh Happy I think he will hold that position for a while as they don't have well now that sha has been sent off he's suspended for three games I think Dan burn has to say it's Center back and so that helps Lewis Hall's case so happy to whole for now let's see how that goes Saka and havitz best I mean the best players in this team Saka and havitz 12 and 12 havitz Max bonus which is you'll have seen I think a few threads on Twitter this week about how the new bonus points is syst has changed things and I think one of the most uh Visible Changes you can see is that forwards now get more bonus points and it seems to favor them quite a bit and so Harvard's who didn't have you know once again slightly withdrawn you talk to people who are very concerned about Harvard's heat Maps this wouldn't have changed their minds because he was playing quite deep but he still got his goal early on he still got an assist a bit of a lucky assist cuz he it's a simple sideways pass to Saka Saka does something amazing but he's in that position where he can do those things that's why he's there that's he's in this team for his link up play for his holdup play for his ability to bring Saka and Martinelli and odard into the game and so I think he gets more of these assists I I wouldn't be surprised if he havs you know touching down and holding up balls for guys who are going to then score from long range efforts and that's just it's just going to help him to keep ticking over 90 minutes this week Jesus came on didn't replace harits anyone who told you that harvz was a risk preseason we were quite clear about it we've he's been in both mine and Sam's drafts throughout preseason and stayed in our teams for game week one how is on a great great great run of form I mean it's 17 goal contributions in his last 15 I me eight million man I me you C you cannot ask for something better than that I would say at this point he's he's almost a better asset than Saka but they're both great assets to have and I think you hold them as long as you they're season Keepers basically uh regardless of fixture I think you just keep they'll keep returning they might have the occasional blank here and there but they will just be consistent asset so you want to keep Saka great what a goal I mean something out of nothing but just bit of a shift he's basically become iron Robin now where he just you know what he's going to do he's going to cut in he's going to shoot but you can't stop it I mean that's amazing Salah great asset I think uh some you know fears you might have had is Salah going to be as effective under on the slot is he going to be as attacking is he going to be stuck out on the wing none of that mattered got into the right positions he's being supplied all the dangerous balls he needs by Trent and he's link up play with jotto is great I think him and jotto work well work really well together and the fact that him and jotto work I think better than he would with Darwin who didn't even get a minute this week is great news for jota owners 7.5 million for starting forward for Liverpool I think easy hold so that's the team bench I had Anthony Robinson uh who will come into to play this week as we see so this is the team this week and as you can tell Dean Henderson in goal I'm worried about Palace I will say that um I'm not too sure that uh the sale of Yim Anderson would hurt them that much but the fact that they're not only selling Anderson but gayi as well that's worrying because they're going down to their backup center backs I think would be Chris Richards and Riad chadii I think someone who they've signed recently the issue with this is first of all Palace played three at the back in gaming one and glasa can't do that going forward if he's selling two of his best center that's one issue second issue is you bring in new set of backs who haven't played preseason that that's going to be tough and I think Henderson's going to have a lot more work to do it's not a subtle defense anymore and by breaking up the defensive units I just don't see many clean sheets I think it's almost a sign of lack of ambition selling two of your starting center backs so I think Dean Anderson's definitely not one who's going to stay in this team a long for you know for a long period of time early W card he's definitely out if I don't W cart early I mean it's something to think about right because you saw Rya bonus points clean sheet this week Edison bonus points clean sheet and I think the I don't even know it's common wisdom but the sort of the reluctance to pay the premium for a keeper maybe I just need to park that and it's time to go back to premium Keepers again because of the way the bonus system has changed to favor them where Defenders get penalized a lot more for fouls and so that's why it seems like Defenders are giving up their bonuses to Keepers so that's something to consider Anthony Robinson happy to have him on the bench so great to bring him in this week I think it's not an easy fure leester I thought started off really poorly against Spurs but grew into the match and by this by the end of it they should have beaten Spurs so I'm not overly confident about a Robinson clean sheet and I mean Sam particularly is annoyed because he already had Yim Anderson burn loo and a Robinson so he's walking into this week with triple Fulham defense so I won't complain I'm quite happy um I'll be annoyed if they keep a clean sheet because that means it's triple cleans for Sam but is what it is Pedro porro I'm hopeful that he'll start if he doesn't I've got Lis Hall to come in so I'm not too worried bayaka uh jot son solanki haritz isak all happy to start them I think Saka and haritz a lot of people thought this is a tough fixture but Villa gave up quite a bit of chances against West Ham they looked quite open and I think uh it's it's an okay fixture for the Arsenal guys not an easy one but definitely one that I wouldn't have hesitation about starting them in I think they'll be anxious to avenge the defeat against Villa last season and so this is kind of a test for ateta and I think having these guys they definitely start they definitely play 90 and they will be part of his plan to try and basically get that win back um the three Spurs guys Everton home is the best fixture you could want to try and bounce back Everton were really poor against Brighton they just didn't impose themselves on the game red card came quite late in the game a lot of people tell you oh because of the red card they lost but Ashley got sent off on 66 minutes so they still you know they had an hour and they just couldn't match up to Brighton yeah they unlucky maybe not to get a penalty but they just didn't show up um no fight I mean that Midfield looks poor they've lost Onana and they have signed Tim arunam who's a young midfielder from Villa but he's really raw he's playing uh next to idrisa ganag who's 34 years old and looks it I mean he really looks it Das didn't want to start their new center back uh O'Brien who they signed from from Leon said he started Michael Keane and Ashley Young at right back so Michael Keane at Center back and both just not not up to this level anymore they've got no right backs this week so young is out Patterson is out Coleman is out and so they're probably gonna have to play Mason Holgate who came on he's I mean Mason holgate's failed at enough Premier League clubs at this point for you to know that he's not up to this level so I think uh some Salan poro if there was a fixture to bounce back this is it I think home to everon I definitely quite happy to have them maybe not as confident to give them captaincy but that's because I've got Salah and all the models suest that Salah isn't far behind haran for predicted points this week and some people are surprised by that but I don't think it should be surprising I think Lal are that good at anfield and Salah with more points for a clean sheet more points for a goal I'm I'm cautiously optimistic that he gets near harand this week um triple Captain Holland for those who've got him e would I do it it's a hypothetical and so it's hard for me to say but I think it's a fair it's a fair gamble to take you especially those of us who have been burnt by you know the failure as of triple Captain over the last few years with double game weeks this is as good a single game week as you may get it's early in the season there's no UCL risks no minutes concerns uh the issue that I think you face is that you may get a better chance and you don't know right because we've got probably one to two double gamings to come in this season according to Ben kin so you may get a better opportunity somewhere else you don't know because we don't know how those fixtures will line up you've also got this mystery chip we don't really know how that comes into play and so we don't know what we don't know basically there could be a better chance but this could be the best chance and so what is your ceiling here with harand let's assume I mean I think your best case scenario is you're looking at a hatrick and bonus which is you know 18 points I guess that's kind of what you're hoping for uh you might end up with 13 times three that's not that's not bad it it could it be worse sure but I think it's it's a fair chance to take I think if you're the kind of person who just wants to get the chip out of the way and that lets you focus on the rest of the season fair enough I'm just I mean I don't have Holland so I can't speak fairly on this but if I had him I think I'd be tempted to wait there's always something you never know what's going to happen down the line if a double game week lines up perfectly there's a chance for a monster score and I think in a single game week it's harder I think you know your floor may be quite High given the fixture but I think your ceiling just isn't high enough for me me to want to do that uh this early in the season I think uh yeah it's kind of sentimental as well it's just feels way too early for me to start throwing all my chips on the table but I I that's not a logic based argument and I can definitely see all the logical arguments for doing it this week so fair play if you want to go for it I think it's fair to try and go early no rotation no Alvarez anymore so nobody's going to come off the bench for Holland I don't think and it's as good a fixure as you'll get and since it's such a good fixture that's my transfer in this week and that's Rico Lewis for Quanza yeah I'm going from one minute risk to another sure it's uh probably going to backfire it's probably a stupid move but I think it's a good fixture I think Le starts um everything I've seen from fans suggest and you know never trust fans but I think Lewis is safe to start this week and I think I'll take it from there given that wild card gameweek four or game we six is the likely destination for me I think it's fine to take a short-term punt on a city Defender who's 4.5 who I mean he could have scored against Chelsea right he had the gold this allowed so he's really attacking I think he and him being in the site kind of forces gardial to have to draw back and play as a third Center back that's good because guys are paying six mil for guardal you can pay 4.5 for Lewis and you may get much more from him and yeah you could you could end up in a situation where he ends up being rotated or he ends up losing his place but I think people forget how it started with Forin for the longest time Forin was not nailed rotation risk uh still not trusted to lead the line to become a permanent starter but then as things progressed you know something flicks you know something changes and then foron becomes First Choice Lewis has been around this team long enough I mean we've been here before where he's had great performances and then you've never see him again for another six months my feeling is you know he's we're getting to that stage where he's got a breakr um and I think if you're going to take a risk start of the season when you've got transfers wild cards Escape Routes is a fair time to take that risk and I've got guys on the bench I've got Hall uh who can come in so I'm not famous last words but I'm not too concern now and if Lewis you know if even if City concede and let's say City draw I actually don't care because I just want harand the blank right that's why I've got the the Jersey right I'm I'm I'm with Edan this week right uh okay I'm I'm I'm all in on I switch uh if they can keep City down to two goals I'll be thrilled Lewis keeps a clean sheet even better and if they don't I I'm not too concerned 4.5 million City Defender who at least I hold until the international break and then reassess so that's a team and we'll see how it goes good luck to you green arrows and all that and we'll catch you on the next one,3850
27,fplbanger,W5nj10pXWzw,You&#39;d have to be crazy to think about replacing Quansah with Rico Lewis That&#39;s where we come in.,2024-08-21T13:02:24Z,I'm mildly tempted to sell for a certain 4.5 million Defender who looked amazing this weekend and has a really good fixture this week but and I mean I'm also Faithfully aware that I'm probably doing the same all over again which is I said quano was bad idea not nailed you know you're GNA have to sell him at some point and I'm thinking of replacing him with Rico Lewis okay okay I mean there is a chance so if you notice with pep um when he brings in young players right they always have a few seasons of Being rotational options until they have that one season where they establish themselves as first choice that was foran last year there was finally his breakout and this could be Rico Lewis finally breaking out and replacing KY Walker as the number one choice you know at the right back this could be it so,155
28,fplbanger,u0d2EHccRvw,FPL GW2: TRIPLE CAPTAIN HAALAND ? - FPL Tips 2024/25,2024-08-20T06:18:07Z,oh this a thing hello everyone and welcome back to the FPL Banger show my name is Sila I'm joined by Sam for a game week one part well it's gaming two point but post gameing one Sam how you feeling about I know what I thought was a very decent game we say yeah I mean I'm ready for the start of the season now you know last we was nice trial run this week is is the start right nobody yeah that's was a nice final friendly before we start the season no J I didn't I don't think I have a good game with honestly SAA I haven't even checked my score um so we can do that together now I have no idea how many points I've scored but I know it's really bad because I did not have all the good players and I just want to point it out I feel like it's really rare that everyone returns in the first game we like how many times have we seen a 100 Pointer possible 100 Pointer game we one you know where pretty much every popular pick return um pretty almost you know especially the popular popular fbl uh Community pcks I think let's put it that way a lot of them I would say from looking at Twitter this morning the average is somewhere in the 50s and 60s is what I would say low 60s to you know high 50s Fair few blanks which we will talk about a lot of template picks didn't work out but then again you and me Sam we we don't mess about with the template you know we we go our own way so let's have a look at oh my team don't look good sa I mean that's uh it's okay since I've pulled the the picture long enough both teams look kind of weird but uh uh so let's let's talk I mean let's talk your team first s because I think that's the one that people want to empathize with more I think people there's a sort of thing is shardan freuder Right everyone watchs no one wants to watch like a team doing well they want to watch a a man going through some pain so let's let's talk about your yeah I I'm going to try and count it here I think it's three for burn Leno one for Quanza zero we should we talk about that later or we'll definitely talk about later we'll come around it okay so zero for yi Merson five for LS hall eight for Doo jot three for Bruno Fernandez three for Gordon uh two for K Palmer five for Alexander isak 12 for Kai havitz very good well done your highest score of the week and let's talk about Captain my only think yeah um yeah Captain son I did not expect spur to be so bad you know um well which we'll get into we'll get into the individ individual ual players and teams later but as a whole you know I went very differential heavy maybe a bit too differential but that's just the way I like to play I thought about it this morning like why did I do this to myself and go without Salah without harand without Saka without a trend without an Arsenal Defender I realized you know I'm kind of bored of FB actually we've been playing for like 11 12 years and you got to find ways to make it fun again I guess make FPL fun again and and this is just my way of doing it I know the proper way to play you know I know I know the safe way to play I just refuse to follow it because that's how you get fun in so I would say for anyone who kind of like me you went a lot of differentials did not really have a good week you just got to own it you know just own it you picked your team for a reason maybe it's over the first few fixtures like most of my team I picked because of their first three or four fixtures so just got to have faith Don't Panic no knee jerking very ironic for me because I actually have very very bad knees but I'm going to keep them strong this week and um just keep the faith in my team Own It sa just own it I don't think this is a very differential heavy team Sam I'm looking at it now I mean you got I think what 46 points I think total from this which isn't great but that's better than what I expected honestly 46 I mean to be fair it's I it's the first week so I wouldn't Panic you know I I think uh you don't you don't lose uh your entire season in one week and nobody here that you have in this team is particularly outrageous uh maybe uh Cole Palmer was lowly owned for gamei one sure maybe really he's highly owned by the players in general but just very lowly owned in the FPL Community I think the FPL content creator Twitter Community yeah but you go into game week to with Co Palmer and I guarantee you that 90% of the FPL Community is not going to have C in gaming too uh they're not even going to have the transfer to you know the ability to get him in because of the way they would have structured their teams so I wouldn't uh lose sleep over that I'll tell you what annoys me see I transferred out wood and masra like five minutes before deadline they were in my team you know I was looking at mu's team and I I realized Master will probably start Dal will probably move to left back let's let's take a chance then I transfer them five minutes before they and that's a good 18 points so yeah yeah yeah but I mean you I'm sure you would have had like draft number 35 would have been the one draft that you scored 100 points with then you know that's true but this was my final draft I think that makes it hurt the most it was my final and then I don't know people I I got caught up with people telling me you're crazy to bench Palmer for wood play Palmer and I was thinking then it doesn't make sense to bench wood I might well sell him and that's why it got me but it's okay it's okay I'm keeping the faith yeah you you can't speak to people in the last hour mate in the last hour I just sat by myself in the zone uh you know trying to keep my kids from you know making noise and stuff and I was focused and in the last hour I took harand out mate you I didn't even talk to you I just I just did it you sometimes just got to you just got to go with your gut enough about my theme sa talk about yours yeah you can see on the screen 77 uh I think decent week uh Dean Henderson Quanza hall five 409 let's see if that holds uh I think it will hopefully he's not injured long term Saka 12 Salah 14 Jo jot 8 havitz 12 isak Captain 10 soan and son I'm so disappointed with Spurs let's let's talk about Spurs right now because I mean what what was that performance how do you I think for anyone who has Spurs assets you just got to keep them right because they're playing at home against Everton but you're right sa like I have no idea why were they playing so bad against one of the so-called weakest team in the league the weirdest part about it was Spurs were really good in the first half I thought a lot of great movement they basically Lester didn't have a sniff leester had one shot from like the halfway line from Bobby re and apart from that it was all Spurs they kept they had something like 10 Corners in the first half so it was all oneway traffic should have been two three n up at half time and then the moment second half comes and the moment the V goal went in they just panicked and they just no game management nobody's you know telling guys keep your heads none of that they just completely lost it and they never recovered let's talk about Jimmy buy zero preseason minutes down the Red Bull at halim came on scored reminded everyone that he has a premier league medal and they don't um 5.5 I'm actually kind of tempted and you know we don't really look at fixtures for promoted teams but Leicester actually has pretty you could say good fixures um scorable fixtures at least maybe I mean okay so we got the fixtures up on the screen now leester Fulham Villa Palace Everton Arsenal bber hey I mean you've seen words yeah 5.5 for body I don't know will he start every game I I'm not sure don't know I mean the manager wasn't planning to start it like I don't think he even passed his medical he just said I spoke to Jamie and he told me he was good to go so I trust him you you guys who this experience you can just let them do what they want so I mean if he wants to play he's playing well and back to SP back to SP what what are we going to do with SP assets keep forever despite how bad it went I mean we take them I think in terms of which B assets are the popular ones to start with poo if we don't know we're recording on Tuesday so if porro is out sure of course you you would sell because at 5.5 that's a lot of money and Spurs fixtures turn pretty soon so I think that's a fair sell we talk about options because we're going to get Defenders after this sun and sank for those who own I own both um a lot of people have sanki uh you have Sun I think you definitely keep because Everton were that bad against Brighton uh should have lost by more goals they are playing well they have no right backs so Ashley got sent off against Brighton uh Patterson's injured Coleman is injured uh so they they have nobody uh and they played Michael Kean BR TW is out again so they they play Michael Keen in defense um lot of issues at Dev and I think uh you definitely if your Spurs guys it's okay yes they played badly against Leicester maybe they needed to get it out of their system uh maybe you know we we joked about it as St but this is kind of preseason for all these teams they've spent six weeks flying all over the world playing inconsequential games they're not really ready for the season a lot of them are operating at like 50% and they'll take some time to get in the groove Spurs is still a good team still a top five team I'll keep for all right shall we talk about um Liverpool next yeah and I think and probably from Liverpool we can address the the question a lot of people have uh I thought L were really good right like um first half bit slow but then and we so that preseason thing right but as the game progressed they got much better uh Salah was excellent I'm very satisfied that I have Salah and I'm you know we'll talk about Holland soon but I I I feel fine with Salah I think Salah looks great I thought Trent looked amazing like yeah yeah I have to admit um watching Trend I think his back to his best and I'm definitely looking at ways to get Trend back in my team I have the funds to do so so I may may just do a cheeky qua to Trend straight that's that's like the easiest move you make I mean that's the move that I want to make and I got I got no funds to do it now yeah definitely do that I think uh you you pay the premium because he was all over the page he was he created the chances that led to the goals he got an early stop which is good because means he's going to keep banking clean sheets I think yeah and I think um a lot of good crosses for jot so I'm really happy to keep jot in my team you know could have easily came off with two goals or more um so I'm happy with J Trend definitely I want to get back in Salah I do not have and I totally forgot about game week one Salah like we did not mention in any of our preseason part game week one Salah is goed it's the king you know he wears the crown but you know heavy is the hit that wears the crown sa let's see if he can keep it up the next few game weeks because I'm still skeptical about the price maybe however you know it didn't work out for me this week so maybe I can't I can't say too much let's see over the course of the next few weeks I mean yes that's probably the easiest fixture but if he carries on like that I mean 12.5 mil is nothing for that I mean let's before we sort of move to city and yeah let's let's talk about city right so city were good against Chelsea and got but you're paying 15 million for one goal and I I mean I'm not going to tell people to sell Harden obviously he's got a switch next I'm scared and I'm hiding behind the couch but this week no no comparison I mean you you definitely got your money worth to Salah and Holland's gonna have to basically score a hattrick against I in my opinion for me to be particularly scared yeah I I will admit right now Salah does look better than harand um in terms of you know value over pric and everything like that I mean harand is so expensive however yes he did get just one goal against Chelsea but if you watch it there was so many times if City's delivery were better or if the Wingers saw his runs he was open a lot you know so we'll see I I I like the whole hland curella thing that was going on though that was that was a bit fun for those of you who don't know um kurella asked for harand [ __ ] last season and then when he won the Euros there was a song about um Holland being scared trembling something like that right and then hanen just dominated karella for the goal so yeah Al just straight up you think you're better than me shut up boy but I mean what do you think about Chelsea because a lot of people have inko and I had a lot of fun I think but you and I were very skeptical about Chelsea to start the season and that's why none of us neither was ATU a lot of people panicking because he subed before 60 they've signed uh he was subbed off for a Portuguese Winger and they've decided yesterday let's sign another one so they signed J Felix uh to go with Inu they've got Netto they've got kmer they got Mario they got mudri they've got guu they've got Jackson they've got agents yeah telling in his agents putting out statements uh same time as kickoff I'm I'm surprised I'm not in the squad God knows what's happening I mean what do you doko I would sell I think unu just basically turned out the way you we predicted it to go right um I would sell I think there's a lot more Alternatives that you can go for at that price that also has good fixtures I would sell honestly all right I'm I'm not as I mean I'm I'm with you that I I don't think enu was a good pick and I he came with all those red flags basically playing for a team that doesn't know it's best 11 and so that's so it proved but I wouldn't I don't sure I would sell simply because where do you go unless you've got and you can't relate to this s because you you're keeping 20 mil in the bank but for the for the human you know the normal people out there they probably have at best5 maybe one mil at the bank and at 6.5 mil where do you even begin to go well if you have one mil you could go up to J um if you if you have the money and you don't have J going down I think um Bailey still looks good he looked good yeah he didn't return but I thought he looked good in particular was very dangerous you could go for one of the fullam boys um you know a lot was say about ESR but again as we mentioned in our previous sport that he probably will get SED off early until he builds Fitness Pereira have actually played pretty well but again I don't know how much of that is fulam or United allowing Pera to do too much I think there are options that you can go for there are they are I think it's harder I mean we we spoke a lot about about 5.5 mes and how how good they are on the previous p and I I sort of as we got closer to the deadline things kept happening um players got injured you know we discussed Oscar Bob and all that and that's why I kind of sold harand was to try and instead of having to rely on any budget mids I have Saka I have Salah I have son and I have jot and so I didn't feel so reliant on all these smaller players because if you look at guys who have for Salah and harand in their draft um they have a lot of these 5.5 minutes and it's a of a lottery like if you had seano this week great if you had M great I mean unlucky that the sub Jacob Murphy is very unlucky to come off early but some people had ESR came off early you had uh guys on Adam Armstrong baritan Diaz like these are not good players J Pedro manag the blank I think it's difficult I don't I don't think I would sell in CUO this week I I I think I disagree with you on that I think I give you give it one more week see where this is going yeah I think it's fair because wolves didn't look good as well so it could just come on just purely as a fixture play while you save another transfer and next week with two transfers you can you know if Uno still get subs off early playing deeper and just doesn't look good in general you could use a two transfers to to work your team around so yeah and maybe this this week they actually send off the Wolves uh Defender when he starts feeling up everybody on the pitch right yeah yeah so I I think the fixture looks good I'm just not so confident on any other asset except for Cole bmer he could have returned U could have got a pen right so let's see I mean he was so cold for the whole of last season let's see if he can keep it up you know in the we got nice a nice fixture run coming in if you brought Palmer in you didn't definitely didn't bring him in for the city game right so this is the time for us to assess and see if he was is worth is a 10.5 million player or was it a one season Wonder let's see okay let's talk about uh K Quanza coming back to Liverpool because I think we a lot of people will have a not just Quanza we had questions actually we did have a question about B and what you need to do a lot of people went with cheap Defenders uh so we got questions here shle I have three yellow flag players and bco uh MCR is the bco dream over before it starts so Sam yes I mean Valen B we got we did talk about Bak in the port and I think when the late news came out that you know he might be dropped I think we probably only posted on Twitter we didn't have time to record the whole part just to tell people don't get V you know um so yeah yeah I mean it looked good but then the sign started to come as you know after we recorded our podcast that he probably be dropped I think if you got Bako you got two options either you sell him quick quick as as of recording the part he hasn't dropped yet right still 4.0 but he will probably be 3.9 by the end of the week and possibly drop down to 3. because quite heavily owned so you got two options right either you sell this week or you just keep him on your bench and you know just eat the price drops focus on your playing team because transfers are valuable as well I mean there are rumors that bco may have had a knock in training and that's why he didn't come on um I a right uh they're linked they haven't signed him yet there's a guy from fanach called kogo who they linked to and they've been linked to for a while chances are they will sign it's Brighton they've got money but even if they do sign it's unlikely that he just walks straight in I'm sure there'll be some time to before you get there but even it comes back as toan comes back there's three that's three players for a left back position yeah but unless bco is your starting left back I mean your starting Defender is one of your three starting Defenders um I don't think this is a priority I mean you just park him at the back of the bench and and deal with it later unless you like transfers are valuable to me and I think you can you in a season where you can keep up transfers you make a much bigger impact you know you take two transfers you get Trent you take two transfers you maybe get somebody way more expensive this is the low impact a 4.5 Defender is not going to score you much more I think than bco did I I agree actually sa I think uh like you said transfers the fact that you can save more is quite valuable and a transfer is definitely worth more than a 0.1 price drop so I would keep I think if I had bule I would just dump him at the edge of my bench third spot and just you know leave him there until I have the luxury to transfer him out yeah but for those who you know let's sort of consider all perspectives here for those who really just can't stand it right you know early season I just need to get this guy out by Fair now what are your Replacements at let's say four mil and 4.5 and I think we stopped that so let's talk four mil I think the problem is a lot of the form players are from promoted teams and a lot of the promoted teams have bad fixtures this week one player who really caught my eye was Jacob gaves you know he had a lot of shots is 4.0 however bad fixture this fix I don't think you want to move onto him you're going to have to explain who Jacob Grieves is made I mean I know who he is but nobody else has a clue who you're talking about Jacob gree play for is um 4.0 Defender and he was very much um I wouldn't say attacking but in every set piece that they take he was seems to be one of their main threats he's tall he's tall he's good he's young in my FM safe he's a world class defender in about six years time so like 100 I think he's like 66 like 190 cm or something so yeah he's tall I mean he's going to score at some point yeah yeah so he looks good the problem is they're playing City this week and you're not going to get a a Defender who play City away you know so I that I don't I don't really see any other four point all options Howard Bellis Saints I mean if you had to play a defend at 4 million uh I think a forest home is okay um if not for didn't exactly look great would got the goal but honestly I think that one deflected shot was the his only um shot or something like that it's only shot no no only shot deflected went in so they don't exactly look good so yeah there's a chance there's a chance um for Saints Defender but honestly if you if you want to s in the four Mill bracket you are you know this is proper bargain being clearance stuff don't really have many options yeah but I'm just trying to empathize because I I I'm mindful that not everybody takes the same approach as we do and for some people it's just almost about not not say mental health but you just feel good that you've gotten rid of a problem so I I can totally and some people feel like team value is essential to the point where a price drop is I've seen I'm talking about like EXP experienced top managers were saying the price drop for Quanza we talk about now is so damaging that you have to get rid of him this week honestly I think there's a chance that K actually starts the next game um yes tactical I think slot came out and said it was tactical and I I've read that you know it was just the the players he was up against did not match well with him but games in which they have more control maybe um they would prefer coner because he has better um building up ability than konate so yeah yeah I mean they said that it was because he was losing all the duels against Liam deat and I suppose the you your takeaway from that is they play Branford next week brenford unlikely to have Tony again uh because he's being linked to move to Saudi and so if it's uo leading the line then do you need konate uh you could have maybe somebody more mobile smaller than having Kate it's yeah it's hard so this is the problem we fa with new managers all the time right so they're they're still finding out who will be their best or 11 best center back bearing whatever it may be so there's always a bit of uncertainty just got a roll with it I guess I mean so you have qu you're not selling I have qu I'm I may I may sell for Trend I don't know I haven't decided yet okay yeah see you got funds that's fair I mean I I would tell if I could upgrade great but for people who I think most people are in my situation where they have cons and no funds in the bank and I I really I knew this was going to be a problem and I shouldn't shouldn't have let it happen but is what it is um I'm I'm mildly tempted to sell for a certain 4.5 million Defender who looked amazing this weekend and has a really good fixture this week but andl I mean I'm also Faithfully aware that I'm probably doing the same thing all over again which is I said quano was bad idea not nailed you know you're going to have to sell him at some point and I'm thinking of replacing him with Rico Lewis okay okay I mean there is a chance so if you notice with pep um when he brings in young players right they always have a few seasons of Being rotational options until they have that one season where they establish themselves as first choice that was foran last year that was finally his breakout and this could be Rico Lewis finally breaking out and replacing Kyle Walker as the number one choice you know at the right back this could be it so I I don't know SAA it's will be risky for me a bit too risky however you know big you you don't win the lottery if you don't buy a ticket I mean let Ric Le was amazing as Chelsea I think anybody who saw the game would have been so impressed I mean I would say Inu was subbed off because R Lewis was that good uh he was causing so much problems for Chelsea that they had to take auku off and bring on somebody who could actually run up and down the flank because Lewis just kept making runs into the box scored a goal which is disallowed and legitimately so but still so attacking and uh I mean I switch next it's kind of why am I tempted yeah it's bad for all the reasons we said quano was bad in some ways it's worse because pep you know is a psychopath slot we didn't know now we know like like pep never tells the truth you're going to waste hours of your life watching press conferences hoping for a hint of him saying Louis is very good so is Kyle Kyle is so good more than you can believe Kyle is amazing he's a family man I love Kyle uh and Rico Lewis will be very good if he gets a lot of minutes but we don't know how many minutes he will get I want to tell you yeah but but but uh but buing all you know parking all that to one side you get uh Rico Lewis for probably especially if you're looking at early Wild Card which I think all of us were talking about gameing six uh in general you get him for IP switch and maybe West Ham I I would I would love to have that a city attacker effectively for two really good games I thought West time were awful against Villa I mean mhm you're not tempted you you know just a little bit temped not really I think I like differentials I like reer but this is a bit too risky because it may very well just be a one we punt before kaker comes back in until he establishes himself right if Kaka is fit but he's still playing then I will go in I think that's I I don't want to play the pep roulette s we'll see I mean pep really I mean obviously doesn't make make a difference P did speak really well about Lewis I think he was quite happy Walker was on the bench the whole night he didn't come on I think Lewis has that spot for maybe a few more weeks until pep you know until he looks funny at Pep in trading and then is banished back to the reserves but especially I also you know mentally the international break is game week between three and four so some people have even spoken about gaming four while which is probably too early but if you get LS now you get these two games and then if you get to brenford and he's starts again then you know you're safe already because you've sort of made it through that you know International break and maybe more because Walker has to go for England duty but then could happen to Louis to to be fair so yeah let's see this may just be copium I guess but I'm I mean it's it's a nice pun the option is there for you listeners you choose to take it or not you know it's up to you but uh we're just opening your eyes to the possibilities right yeah because I mean Quanza is a risk sure but I don't think K Quanza being ultimately a bad pick has any effect on whether Lewis is a good pick or a bad pick I mean I think they're two you're just sort of bringing in the past with your past mistake should not affect your future right well said deep going very deep okay so for the people want to go R he's there but talk to me if you're boring you know you want to just have a safe 4.5 million Defender who played who do you transfer kza out this week for Robinson I think Fulham now really starts you know a really nice three- game Run Leicester is switch West Ham home away home and then Newcastle at home away Forest so it's possible but I think a lot of people already have Anthony Robinson um and if you I mean I do so would you look at I guess if we're thinking about people who aren't have owned I guess dun and kza are quite common what about masawi let's let's talk because you know uh 10 years ago you wouldn't have even had this discussion you just bought the highest scoring defender in gameing one 4.5 million so why not maeri look really good yeah but United fixtures I think doesn't look too good and we actually considered a lot of chances I think we had a lot of last minute saves and you can do that every week you know last minute tackles last minute interceptions uh goal line clearance and that was against Fulham so United plays Brighton Liverpool then we have sof handed that that looks like a good fixtion on paper then Palace against a Spurs Villa doesn't really look too good he he on his own looks impressive though it's just a fix CH for me same with Brighton as well United Arsenal the next two and then after that yes if Swit nor both home games that that two game Run looks good then Chelsea and SP so doesn't I don't know doesn't really inspire me confidence as well you could go Hall I think who I think because of the red cut he has a higher chance now retaining retaining his place so Hall could be an option if you don't already have Hall other than that I don't really see that many Alternatives in the 4.5 bracket unfortunately I think I like conza for people who really need to make a transfer I think it's a bad fixture this week sure but if you look past that and uh you can see the FDR chart we have on screen which is by the way we should say from Reddit it's from smog DMD see we give credit um yeah redit users smog DMD man of culture obviously a lot of rings fans so we like that uh so yeah so kza Ging to Aral sure bad but then leester Everton RS it switch I think that's a really nice run mhm agreed if the only reason I wouldn't get coner is if you are waiting like me for gaming three and to see if you can get Ian Marson in because I thought Marson was really good as a sub yeah yeah I think Matson has always or not always but he has he has always shown that potential um to be a very attacking Wing back so it looks great he is 5.0 so it is reflected in the price I have cona he's sitting on my bench um planning to start gaming three onwards kind of happy his nail at least but on the whole Villa didn't really inspire me with confidence in their backline so they gave a lot of chances to us that's that's and I'm feeling however you know it's just a fixture play I think if you're getting game victorys it's purely a fixture play yeah think so okay so that's 4.5 million Defenders and kind of the Quanza kungu issues I think we've covered I mean that's uh talk about something has become bit more popular in the last few days at least uh and that's been triple Captain so for those who Wonder recall on the first part we mentioned that there aren't going to be many double game weeks this season probably just one and so the Temptation especially if you bench boost in that double game week is to look at a single game week for triple captaincy and so the feeling harand this is team at home yeahand against how how much Harland against a promoted team at home no threat of Champions League rotation no issues about minutes you know he's fit he'll play will you get a better chance than this later in the season and a lot of people feel it's worth going for this week we both don't have Holland so this is hard to talk about without bias but you know pretend S I think if you can do it that'll be great but I think it's one of those things where a lot of people have the idea but they're not actually going to do it you know I don't think all you guys really got the backbone to do it but the idea the concept of fresh Harland early in the season and um I spoke last week you know you tend to see less clean sheets at the start defenses not so organized at home against a promoted team and hland has an excellent record against promoted teams this could be it this could be it I just I don't know something about it feels so weird and wrong about using a chip in game week to I don't know but that that makes no sense like that has no logic it's just I'm being sentimental about the chips I wouldn't want to use it all now but I think we got to adapt so like you said less chances of a double game Wick so we always traditionally have saved the chips the Ben Bo the triple Captain for double game weeks but if we're not going to get that this season we got to adapt silver got to adapt improvise adapt overcome yeah I don't know man I I just it just feels like it's too soon like City aren't at Full Steam and I thought if were okay against Liverpool like they they could I thought they look really good in the first half honestly yeah maybe they could surprise City I'm hoping that is copium that is scorion sa okay so basically you're you're you're sold on Triple Captain like if you had Holland you'd do it if I had Holland I would 70% consider possibly doing it very interesting okay I'm just not there yet I feel like that there will be times in the season when you will somehow you know you just there'll be a bit more momentum and you'll feel it uh I also suggest you may want to look at a midfielder rather than harand who kind of to make this really worth it has to score a hattick I think or at least two goals and an assist or something of that sort because you saw he scored a goal at the weekend seven points which is nice but then Salah one goal one assist gets double that and so I think Holland's Got to do a lot of work to make this worth it I just I don't know it just feels too soon like I I feel like you want to uh you know let the information who knows King Charles could die right and then we get [Laughter] another whoa s whoa whoa ban in the UK for that hey I'm just saying you know like you remember the queen died and then we suddenly got an extra free hit chip you know things happen right yeah yeah that's true can we talk about Arsenal by the way I don't think we we haven't um but so me and you we had our confidence in havitz paid off yeah come on hav my boy King Kai let's talk about other assets is it worth okay let's talk about is it worth bring an Arsenal player in despite their upcoming bat fixture so they're about to play Villa away Brighton at home and then they got a double against Spurs and City both away before some nice six years two home games against Leicester and Southampton I think um this week was a good reminder of the fact that Arsenal like City one of the best teams in the league and so the fixtures are not as important we always used to say this about City you don't really care about the fixtures like you back them and we've got to adjust our priors with Arsenal and think about him the same way is what I would say like I would expect arsal Villa is a tricky one but I expect arsal to beat Brighton I expect arsal to be Spurs uh city is obviously not great and then you get less than Southampton so I I think if you I would just go in like I would have wait I mean I thought Harvard was excellent we saw Villa give up enough chances against West H so I wouldn't be afraid about Harv's not returning Saka one what is it one chance one goal it's basically iron Robin now everyone knows he's going to do the same thing he just does it again like cutting shoot cutting shoot um yeah I would totally get AAL plays and the we dissed you know you Sam especially but me too we dissed premium Keepers right we said you know you're a [ __ ] if you spend 5.5 million on a keeper Edison and Rya bonus points this week and maybe the system has changed maybe we need to start thinking you maybe maybe maybe you know like I said earlier we got to adapt sometimes so we used prior information but the bonus point system did change this year and if that makes premium Keepers even more valuable then we got ad that but I'll still monitor for now yeah and Ry is the cheapest route into that defense and that I think that's got to be real selling Factor yeah so I mean Palace were really awful this week and Dean Henderson waste of my time I think I think by gamei I don't know gamei 3 definitely I I will start considering maybe getting Rya in moving things around yeah to your to answer your question yes get Arsenal players in I think they're safe and fixture proof effectively at this point and I wouldn't let the one bad fixture in game week five worry me now I mean you've got four weeks until then and I think just to remind people they did pretty well against City last year yeah kept them to two clean sheets I mean this is a good team and I think uh the best fixture may not be that bad of a fixture yeah I think uh we you know just to wrap up on Harvard's but you you get so much more for what you're paying at 8 mil for harits versus you know any other midfielder for in that bracket I think yeah imagine if had this week by far the stand out pick in that it Mill brecket yeah people just too afraid of Jesus as far as I'm oh however you know Bruno almost had a hall at two big chances and if he put that away Bruna 8.5 playing false n although I don't know if that will continue this week because um Joshua came on and scored we'll see we'll see but even then you know if he a 10 if he plays the he plays I'm quite happy with Bruno I mean that'll be on your on his headstones you know Bruno Fernandez he almost had a hall um but yeah he played well he played well and I I definitely wouldn't worry about Bruno Fernandez own deal okay so that's we we covered all the the main topics for the SOS out there Sam you know before we wrap up for the sickos out there like you and me who don't have harand what are we doing with cap C this week o oops knocked my mic I'm sorry about that everyone I'm tempted on Kai that's where it is right now Kai harz um it's between Kai harz Bruno and jot for me oh yeah you don't have Salah I don't have Salah either so I can I have to take the next best thing which ISO y because you you started I was like what what is this guy talking about why okay I mean objectively objectively if you had all the players in the world and all the choices the best Captain would be harand that's and the next best Captain would be Salah but let's talk about number three who is the third best Captain because that's where the conversation gets interesting you know I was going to say a SP player but after last night I I would be terrified on paper it looks good right you know against Everton but but yeah I I SP just too spursy for me very spury I mean they lived up to all the stereotypes so no jot I mean if you got J I mean I don't see why not uh bit of a gamble but if you don't have Salah same sort of theories apply right and he played 90 I think um Nunes did not come on which Bots really well yeah Nunes know J didn't come off he came off a gako but it was towards the end yeah but close um 70 plus but no doub yeah the point I trying to make is that Darwin did not come on to sub off J which was what everyone was expecting so it looks good I mean it looks like he will continue to keep that Striker spot and I mean he scored like what he can't complain slot can't complain right you got to start him again no I think yeah he got 79 minutes against if he scored I think he played well he he will lead the line again I think we we those of us who gamble got where we wanted if you had fulam players would you be tempted or probably less so having seen Lester play yesterday Captain a fullham player I mean I'm happy to keep that Captain Captain is a big F to too big a responsibility too big too big just be happy to have some full home players I think I I've double I have two full home Defenders I have Leno and Robinson so okay okay I think that's everything for this week right yeah that's it short one this week or a bit longer than I thought we go about 45 minutes but still it was good s nice to chat with you and I'm looking forward to the rest of the season it's quite it's been quite interesting I would say I mean let's put it this way if harand blanks will'll be back next week and if he scores four goals you may not see us for a while is what I would say no no we are committed we are committed to the part but bad weeks good weeks will always be here yeah I've bought my kit ready for next week so I will be wearing that regardless of the result but come on Jacob gri goal one zero to if switch K Mna I and we there also another play XEL tan Exel you know is the only starter in the entire swich team who had ever played a Premier League game wow weekend okay okay interesting I don't know if that's good or bad but I guess we'll find out after the weekend yeah yeah so um I think that's it for us this week yeah but in the meantime Sam get your green arrows but before that before that you know if you if you triple captain harand please screenshot it and let us know I want to see I want to see if anyone really has the backbone for it and if it works out you know don't get too big for your boots it's a long season so just enjoy your haul and we go again,8349
29,fplbanger,LyNTM-hayuc,FPL GW1: FINAL(?) TEAM REVEAL - FPL Tips 2024/25,2024-08-15T04:21:05Z,oh this a thing hello everyone welcome back to the fbl Banger show my name is Sila I'm joined by Sam for an emergency P Sam one day before the deadine two episodes in the same week C we are on fire that that early game uh I mean preseason first week first gaming of the Season fever is finally hitting us h i mean if people didn't know they would think we were unemployed but uh no we haven't been fired from our jobs we we just I just woke up uh to the news that Oscar Bob has um May you know may may his soul rest in you know peacefully uh after one week of being in everyone's team is now gone forever basically sidelined sideline B minus seem reference for yeah yeah and and you know uh it it's completely ruined my day Sam what what's it done to your day um kind of sucks before I went to sleep last night I finally you know everyone's been telling me that I've been leaving too much money in the bank so I used start 0.5 to upgrade Harry Wings the Oscar Bob just to appease the masses and then Bob get injured so I think this is a sign you know leave that n Mill in your bank Sam don't touch the team so so basically you are the guy who should blame you know that that that move I'm sorry everyone who wanted to take a punt on Oscar Bob I disrupted the the harmony of the world of the FPL World by bringing him in last night yeah but such such is life um shall we look at our current draft Sam and see how this news has changed I mean it's it's completely overall my draft because Bob was you know the guy who made it all work he was like the chosen one right bringing balance to the of my team you say that but wasn't he that on your bench ah well that that's like six we recorded what two days ago that's like 20 drops ago I mean two this is is basically like two months in FPL te exactly yeah it's like dog years M it just it just runs okay so let's uh let's see where we are at now you go for you have more traditional draw so you go first yeah I mean yeah we've spent a lot of money on Graphics this season as you can tell so uh so my draft on the right hand side is Dean Henderson yosco gardio Lewis Hall Pedro poro uh mosala Dio jot Jacob muy yakobo M Holland isak captain hars and followed by Morgan Rogers bco and nadell yeah okay who has he play I've never even heard his name Aston Villa 4 million right back I've been in the lab Sam the will he even play no he has been playing in preseason and he played 90 minutes in their most re most recent preseason friendly against Dortmund fans are quite excited by him who's be his comption okay okay okay yeah all right and apparently cash is uh in the dogghouse and has you know emy's been even last season you'll recall that cash was getting rotated in and out I think was playing right back yeah yeah so I have a 4 million Aston Villa right back and my feeling is look if bco doesn't play if Rogers doesn't play if I'm down to my last guy things have you know basically [ __ ] has hit the fan anyway so um there there's no real difference between getting howwood Bellis who's nailed for his two points when I could who knows Aston Villa starting right back for 4 million maybe I I do think though that it's probably because Kana you know coming back late from euros and things like that and once he's fully fit he will go back to right back however wor a pun I think wor a pun at 4.0 you know if he doesn't play he's the same as any other 4.0 f is going to St on your bench anyway it's the difference between zero and two points made and I think one thing we didn't talk about on our part that day was the wild cart window that everyone's looking at uh and even the Nerds right the guys who sit and study analy itics and whatnot in not us cool F guys who have spent J the jcks of the FPL World exactly the jcks of the FPL world who have spent at least I spent about three hours listening to a Fulham podcast a Brighton podcast woles podcast but yeah no I think more like Breakfast Club of the F world I think going to show our age with some of these references okay okay go on go on SAA talk serious what I will say is because WKA window everybody's looking at his gameweek six you just need to get five weeks out of these guys that's my general View and with that in mind I'm prepared to take one or two gambl yes I could get somebody who's nail like Ben Johnson if switch right wing back yeah but I mean I don't it's you know much of a muchness so to speak it's I don't see a big difference so that's the team for me uh so the big change is Bob going out means I'm down to Morgan Rogers and I've had to give up Trent but Pedro poro still sexy still a very good gaming one pick I'll learn to live one thing I have changed is LS Hall is in and I you know that day we discussed about how Newcastle and I was a bit scared of Defense but I I thought about what you said you have hall went back to look at the preseason minutes he's played more minutes than any single player for Newcastle full stop and everything I read from Newcastle fans suggest that he should begin the season as their left back so yeah 4.5 million for a starting Newcastle left back you know feels like it's worth a Gamble and I I really like your Jacob Murphy pick I think um I was a bit skeptical you know it could be a preseason PL type thing um but however however um doing more research and reading more on new fans opinion I did not realize that actually he was doing the business you know in the towards the end of last season so it's not like a one-off thing he he's just pretty much continuing his form from the end of last season into preseason so it may both really well for him especially because they have no rightwing replacement however they are in the market so we'll have to monitor with this you know but if they do not bring anyone then yeah Murphy is a great option I went safer I went for Gordon because um yeah just Gord snail in the team I think yeah I mean you've got the cash to spend because you don't have Holland and Salah so fair enough you know I think anybody I I'm not going to dispute Gordon's a much safer pick who's far less likely to get rotated or benched and Murphy carries a lot of risk but I think as we discussed that day there's still a lot of options at the 5.5 million bracket I haven't gone to uh Smith row didn't hasn't made the cut yet I haven't even got to Ben Ben Baran Diaz I there are so many other options so I don't think this is a such a big deal you know it's one of those I I can transfer him out I just want him for the first few fixtures all right so shall we yeah not many changes in my draft sa not many changes pretty much the same as the other day um Henderson my starting keeper back three is quansa bco Hall I have uh Robinson and po Torres on the bench J Bruno Goden Sun my midf and up front I wood havs and Isa now my difference is I did mention earlier on I did upgrade um my 4.5 mid to Bob and then Bob got injured so I was thinking what should I do now should I go for another 5.0 and um I decided to take people's advice and first on my bench is cold farmer so you stop some of that nine mil in the bank oh okay I I'll give you my reason I I don't think farmer starts the first game I don't thing he does I think he comes on against City and then you know game week two onwards Chelsea have good fixtures or much better fixtures um when they're not playing City so I won Palmer in game week two onwards do I keep a f in in the first week and then waste a transfer or should I just you know use that transfer now now I'm still debating all right B on the bench does sound crazy I may bench wood instead so I'll be monitoring the news iting if there's any hint that he might start then wood goes on the bench pmer comes in if it seems like it's true you know he may not start that first game then I may just take the risk of wood with 90 minutes versus Palmer 20 minutes or whatever it may be against City and then game we two onwards um switch them in switch him in and that saves me a transfer down the road I still have a lot of money in the bank I have um I think three or four Mill left in the bank crazy when you think about but uh my plan is to move jot I predict he'll lose his place in about two game weeks just nice for Fen to get back to full fitness and then Fen comes in for jot play a 352 that's my plan a bit of Forward Thinking although although we know sa that you know forward planning never works out the way you want it to but yeah that is my plan that's my reasoning and that's my team I love it I mean uh I think it's nice to see Co in the draft because I I mean it makes no sense that guy who what is it came into FPL in game week eight as a regular starter last season still finish as top scorer is somehow not in anybody's team including mine so I like actually I think um so I I was thinking that you know Palmer is a good differential let me get on him early but then I checked his ownership and it's like 40% so I think the casuals have him like loads of casuals have him um your bubble basically yeah yeah of the FPL bubble like all the serious FPL players are not going in on him but casuals yeah 40 42% or something like that it's huge basically casual sorting by total points last season I think I mean there are there are worst ways to sort people sometimes say what what I do see one issue with your team Sam I'm going to ask you this because it's something I wrestled with as well who the heck are you benching in game week two um I'm keeping my entire team I'm moving wood out for Farmer so that's about it wood play Southampton yeah I know I know I know it does sound crazy but Palmer is just a better player and then surely you could you not you know I'm not trying to talk you out of this but is there not a a more economical way because that feels like a lot of money on the bench I know I I did think about it I did look at the options cheaper than wood so I thought you know maybe just get a f as a for um and play Palmer in gimmick one but you know for all the reasons that I mentioned earlier I think I'm happy with having wood as a one game week pun and even with wood on the bench um I still have enough money to move jot up to um foren and have one meal in the bank still so this is this is the kind of things you can do your team when you don't have Salah or harand yeah I it's still a good team like I look that starting 11 and yeah I mean it's probably better than mine like it's more balanced in the Midfield yeah yeah and I still have money to upgrade the defense you know if I want to however I am still wrestling with this I do agree should I downgrade wood to someone cheaper but I just don't really see any viable options below wood like if I were to downgrade it would probably be the starter is maybe Armstrong I'm not really convinced on South anon's minutes ja Pedro as well sharing might share minutes with well back so I don't really see anyone below so if I were to downgrade wood it'll just be a 4.5 F but then I kind of want that one week punt you know um I mean the good thing about Forest is I expect wood to start and bouth I believe sessi is a doubt so okay if they're missing their best center back that helps uh to your thing about ja Pedro Brighton overnight have spent 40 million on rter from leads uh another forward so and I think um not to pour cold water on your M pick I think they just signed the right wing as well so more competition with M so yeah another midfielder from attacking midfielder from mines uh yeah it's a little worrying I may have to go back to Smith r or Dai kamada who and I think sort of coming full circle to the Bob issue is that again there are so many more Midfield options that we haven't even got into our benches that I you don't even have Morgan Rogers and could be starting forward for Villa on gaming one against West Ham who have lost almost every preseason game so far regardless of how much money they spent and you could actually start Rogers who's on your bench actually oh I'm so tempted I mean I'm honestly tempted to just bring Rogers in go down to Harry wins uh maybe we're all just trying to be too smart here you know Harry wins maybe he's the he is the the one yeah maybe maybe maybe you know he ends up with a hattick in game week one yeah because it's all well and good about having depth on the bench right but let's be real you're never going to call it right because guys you don't always go on the easy fixtures right they they might go on the hard fixtures uh something about Arsenal defense and neither of us have Arsenal defense but I went back and looked at some of the stats thinking about what you know should I have Arsenal defense the fixtures are hard but arsal kept two cliches against Man City last season and then they considered against you know they conceded against Fulham in both games like things don't work out way you expect them to it's what you're saying SAA that we should have Arsenal Defenders now when the fixes it's bad and then transfer them out once they fixtur then it's it's counterintuitive right but I think it but to be real I think there are two points to it one it's hard to predict when clean sheets come but two uh a team naturally sets up to be more defensive and more solid in a game that's against a rival because they cannot lose yeah whereas you can afford to beat Fulham or Southampton 61 you don't really care whereas you play more open so you're more prone to counters as well considering that one goal exactly like looking back to that those two City Games last season for Aral they just parked everybody and they just really did not want to lose and so yeah maybe these difficult fixures a bit overblown and you can't look into it you know can't take it too seriously so things to think about and I I I got to be honest I don't think my draft's final yet I might you know make more changes I think 24 hours is too early to do a final draft because 24 hours is pretty much another 24 drafts or more one for every hour of today oh so healthy but yeah I mean anything else before you know we we might touch base uh you know on at least on Twitter on our socials before the deadline tomorrow but anything else you want to tell me Sam um yeah I just want to address that you know I do have a lot of people telling me are you crazy for going without Harland and my reasoning for that is basically that I feel that foran is just a better pick for's not fit yet and if I get harand now that will really block my ability to bring in foren because I have to take out money from the forward move it into the Midfield is two transfers so I just feel that way I'm okay to go without Harland for for one or without a city attacker for one week maybe two weeks you know if it takes forden that long so yeah but forden would definitely come in my team I think he will be the standout pick in the city team this year I mean I think to people who say that you're crazy not to have harand those people don't have Sun let's be real those people don't have cmer right and so there is this is going to keep happening every time you post the draft you want to do a social experiment go on Twitter go on Facebook post your draft every day take out one guy you'll get the first question where's arel you post a team with no Villa oh no Villa you post the team with no harand no that's true by the way sun is my captain so I've moved him away I moved it away from isak just to just to be different from you sa I don't know if that's a good move or not I'm so temp I'm still so seed by I need like some spurs attack because I just I watched so much of Lester's preseason again they just look so bad like I've got poro there but he's he's not really an attacker is he so maybe maybe I'll go find some more money could get Kulu I think if you won he's been playing number nine right in preseason yeah I mean Solan is here W comes straight in and if he does kulu's form has been really good he might play right wing anyway so just something to think about I think even if San comes in at at the start he's not playing 90 minutes I really don't see that I think that's a lot to ask uh so I think sun is the safe I mean you you ultimately want to get the points and I think Sun's safe I need to go find some money I have a lot s can I loan some to you maybe maybe I wouldn't mind yeah oh let's uh we you know just sort of wrapping up okay so you moved captaincy off fair enough I can't argue against that um Kai har objectively objectively the best Captain this week will be Isa objectively however I think most people will be sticking captaincy on is so I think sun is Main be slightly lower of a you know of a pick slightly riskier of a pick compared to isak but at the same time I think he has a higher ceiling so yeah he's a midfielder for starters right definitely got higher ceiling he's also on pant and he's also playing a promoted team and everybody agrees that Leicester and Southampton have equally bad defenses so no I don't think your I think suns are perfectly son Salah isak all three very justifiable picks this week you could even say jot I think so I I don't see this coin flip you know you you're taking a gamble on somebody who most likely has a high ceiling Isa will need a hatrick to match Sun getting a brace correct correct let's talk about Kai harits you know we got like what few more minutes uh because he's still so interestingly yesterday uh they released the odds uh the betting outs for this week for goal scoring outs and hav is above Saka and all of them and people are very stunned and surprised like how can this be forgetting that hars was scoring almost every game at the back end of last season yeah um I'm not surprised he's their main go threat he has been for the entire of uh the second half of last season so why why are people surprised that it's reflected in the odds you know their main goal threat has the highest odds of scoring this this is a lot of fear and people are scared of Jesus basically I feel like people have really negative bias on haritz maybe from his time at Chelsea and maybe from his earlier time in Arsenal so much so that even though they moved him up front and he's been returning almost every single game continue that form into Euros to show that it's not just a fluke but people still are not convinced on harits I don't know what what what more does the man have to do he's come he's made the move he's turned into a goal scoring forward he's loved by the manager he plays 90 minutes most weeks he's you know he's he the wife has committed to him over the summer Brothers got married he's he's scoring everywhere mean yeah and it's crazy because people don't don't want you know have the same people who do want Harvard have jao Pedro who's got like 60 other forwards to compete with yeah see okay that's true that's true so we are both um hot on harits it's quite a few similarities in our team here we both have handle which I don't like by the way I do not like the fact that we have the same keeper Sam Johnson was stripped apparently of his jersey like I insult injury you already know starting yeah yeah shut lless are walking around shut lless after it's been stripped but we both have handle we have both has hall both have bco although one on the bench one starting we both have J isak havitz so these are common players that we both very hot on I think this is the curse of talking too much as the deadline comes closer we just got to stop you know this is the last we will speak you know until the deadline I think you know what SAA um okay I'm gonna put his name Georgie georgean keeper madash Billy ah yeah he just moved to onef um I mean granny Liverpool bought him and instantly loan him well instantly loan him to bouth I really like him as a pick right I I don't know if he'll be number one in bouth but if he is I really really like him as a big um Euros he was wrecking up saves like crazy not many clean sheets but just saves so many saves that it propelled him you know to close to the top of the goalkeeper rankings these are the kind of players you want kind of bmer can keep occasional clean [ __ ] lots of saves lots of saf equ because a lot of bonus points just something to keep an eye on I think yeah I mean definitely bonou will be a team I me I'm still look tempted by Sano and they fix just turn about I think game six or after that so yeah something to think about yeah yeah okay I think nice short and sweet uh and guess you'll see our teams before the deadline but in the meantime so get your green arrows but before we go before we go SAA let me just say some promo stuff um our

involved I don't know so if you want to sync up to us then it's herzer on the screen I'll tell you when he goes he is going now now it's now it's ten hog to sync up with that I've got the logo on the top right so you know which which game we're we're watching it's Brighton my team versus Manchester United mean do that no where's where's Barco yeah good he's in Spain he's in Spain putting the oh Gilmore's playing that's interesting I thought he was no wife WEA no WEA yeah he's been that's oh I'm nervous about this one I really think we should win this so that means this is tip for tap because if this is first game it's gonna be a good game yeah yeah and it was always gonna be a good game what does that say about city does that say it's not a it's not a cricket score well we we said earlier didn't we that we didn't think City would be the unless IP switch won it or city won like first there's 2,000 people in there watching they're they're that they 2,000 people going it's I'm glad I'm tuning in to see Mark because he's gonna be so happy and oh God first oh that was uh ammad nearly scoring at the near post typical Brighton slow start oh he should have buried that that was a really good chance oh well hopefully you're all um enjoying hopefully lots of you are doing M today challenge with us as well hopefully you've managed to miss the scores I've had a love I'm honest I've had such a lovely day today I've been to the arcade I played some games at the arcade what did you play I played like the basketball game play bit of air hockey you're in you're in is this is that SM this is what we do oh we lost it you haven't got anyone in this game have you no I haven't you've got Pedro right yeah yeah no I really wanted minte but I didn't I didn't go in the end this is Ry yeah what's going on there Bruno down okay why are they showing that that was a nothing incident that was a bit weird is there going to be a bucket no well oh no quick break come on you almost tell the way they cut the highlights as to why that nice play from Bri you predicted the Wingers were going to cause them problems well they look like they're dropping in very narrow aren't they and winning it back this isn't going to be a one nil because it wouldn't be on first Pedro sh Pedro's nine right oh that is what is going on it's absolute carage in the Box matoma yes well again well his former Club come on who was across who was across yeah lovely goal props anyone who went with Moma he wasn't really someone we talked about was he but I think we overlooked him a bit lovely bending great goal again because he was a bit of a bandwagon quite I think did he go up in price he was close to going don't think so oh we're such a good team I love Brighton at the moment obviously loads of goals in this game so yeah that's not going to be it but it's just so we got 2,200 that's okay it's an exciting team to watch whatever happens in this means that then that we're not in for too much pain I think well one of us will be no You' be fine was that yeah abandon players to that's a steal oh god rashford oh no he's off lucky markers yeah they're well off yeah oh God we've got a bit bit lucky here didn't we no he's off yeah yeah okay good I mean did he just kick that up to himself he did he mean to do that if only that did count that was of goal that counted half time half time only one oh my God we're so good come ped we're so good at football come on come on get me something get me an assist ding that's in that's in oh he's in he's clear just an assist with James Miler rolling Back The Years such a good team to watch he's not GNA he's off the pitch is he Pedro 58 did he get the 58 is isn't off is he no he's gonna get an hour isn't he he's gonna that's gonna start to be a thing Milner again oh my God Milner's having a hell of a game it's interesting why they showed this first yeah I thought they'd be a bit more not really classic so far has an hour gone Bruno Fernandez 115th minute winner or something probably so normally goes come let's get another one that's a great ball oh hit the ball come on not getting out oh oh my dad would have been enjoying this Danny Welbeck is on I mean Ferguson I mean we've signed all these like rout and Pedro and everyone but displacing welbeck's not going to be easy the way he's playing I just don't that's off that's offside lman says it's not that wasn't on target was it I think that's a d goal that is or was it a webar goal was that on target ma they've given it they've given it as a goal I thought that was off Target a look oh it's a good goal actually I don't going in i' been coming benit down mazra is very popular wasn't he one of the biggest one of the biggest bandwagons of the of game week one cuz he got the nine got a lot of traffic off of points off of not that Defender I don't like to mention that Liverpool Defender some idiot recommended oh who would do that on loads of space he's in the middle loads of space come on come on put it in should have put it in the Box wrong chice Hold It Back come on boys oh br no oh they're going to counter you here oh no he's going to be Bruno on the man he's going to flip it there he's going to score all the Manu fans oh no that's a he's offside gach played it in and it came off of oh there I don't think it's going to count because because he touched it in it says two1 at the top left though hold on though but it's not a Bruno assist because it went didn't go in from gacho I don't think let's have a look I'm sure no he's on side watch this watch this if it comes off he's offside he touched it in do you think he look like he's already in the goal no I think they've given it yeah he in it or is it I don't know no I don't know about that well he's he's not he's not in the line that's not over the line that's off that's offside that's offside that's offside because that's not they can't say that's he is offside is it CU Z touched it in yeah what was he doing if you have left it I'm not even sure it was going in low to be fair so mayor and Cesar yeah I think so was that him no is that him there in the middle oh no he is on still yeah right oh was that Ino it's really strange because it's like this is one of seven games this isn't a classic does that mean there already any go I'm Ling it this is this is a 94 come on Brion if Mark if we get the winner in the 94th minute Corner in the 94th he's grabbing my leg under the desk I we're doing that anyway to be fair GNA have you for inappropriate behavior come on come on SO Dinger please please someone last last minute penalty for Brighton would be nice to get him back for last Pedro yes [Laughter] I'll have that I'll take it all day I'll take it all day oh I love it that'll be Max bonus as well from oh last minute to get your own back on last season and he stayed on the pitch that's the thing I they made five subs and he stayed don't own it I don't care don't own him don't care what a lovely goal there's no V is there no is W come on wow that'll be that'll be gold and Max bonus I reckon that's a good start I'll take that yeah no what on second game in the Premier League 31 relax 31 years old some points on the ball that's that's probably seven or eight points that harland's got to get now okay I'm hyped now I'm hyped for mata's hatrick surely not two wins in two we are a good team this season we are going to be all up there it's a shame that we couldn't watch that cuz that was the earlier that was a live game and i' like yeah would have been a good game to watch well done J Jo never doubt never doubted J no oh so happy so happy I said two one prediction unlucky highly owned isn't unlucky 10 hog oh that's a good start I'm Happ how about that the touching of goal in like if he left it was it going I'm not even sure it was going in to be fair so I think he had to do it but it's amazing though isn't it like hero in the first game and then in the second game I tell you what Bruno blank again that's B ARS yeah two blanks for Bruno so he's gonna be he's gonna be getting so he was never a good pick though was he so well he was a he was a you knew what you getting blanks well no but you know X-Men and penalties right so he was unlucky in the first game if gach have scored that part is going well when you see that highlight in the 94 minut you're a team attacking you I wonder what does this tell us about City though it tells me that it's a routine win so I don't think it's going to be yeah be a two or three nil I'll take that two or three n I'll take that har could could get all of my but no we done Pedro I'm um I wasn't too hot on him but because of the amount of well options but the fact he stayed on yeah that's the shot for me and he was in the N obviously well right so inter because Well's obviously still beat still scored still played well oh yeah he he might get the B I don't really know but no that's um if you you know 55 J Pedro scoring in the 12:30 you'd be delighted with that would you again though if he hadn't got anything out this he probably no he's not GNA go 57 this is the problem with the price WI a player gets two blanks and suddenly everyone's going to sell them is yeah me just check that my assistant is don't go apparently you need to be a bit closer to the m okay I'm not surprised normally I'm too loud well that's a very new thing you still having an assistant who can look how look how look how they converge around the ball it's like an under eight game they all gone to the ball and left three players on the far post this this is if if you watch James Ott's video about Herz this is what he does the overloading he does causes so many issues but you wouldn't expect it from a corner you could expect better marking from a corner surely look at that nice stats new stats not normally covering this intensive run an intensive run it's a run that's a bit intensive I think I had that last Christmas intensive runs ruined ruined Christmas too much fro turkey ruined Christmas it's nice Havey up in Hitching yeah it's not it's it's weird being in the room where we I see you it's weird that that feeling that I've seen behind the curtain yeah I thought like that when was in your shed sounds weird but I felt little like that yeah yeah but no spiders in here are it's all right well have been a couple around lately but that spider was horrible at yours I still never found it but for the next two weeks I was like imagining it running over my hands while I was tying Terri it's never turned up I guess that's a problem when you're in a shed yeah oh two so that must mean what do you mean like so City Arsenal Bri some props please no no no top of you're top of the league before um it must me I reckon it's Arsenal Villa next it is arsal Villa let's show is it yeah yeah so I'm getting more confident that the city game is not that spectacular but even if it's two-nil City hun harand gets both that's pretty disastrous for you is it it yeah yeah yeah a brace and Max bonus would be probably I would like to have seen Crystal Palace West Ham next because that's just that's just going to be a one-1 isn't it yeah yeah what and sampton for is cuz obviously you think that's going to be the fin game last definitely the last game 100% yeah nil nil I've never been more sure on anything I'll take a draw yeah one1 I think I was impressed with Southampton thought they play well I know they were against 10 men but stuck to their principles oh you see that that run he just made a really good run and they weren't even thinking about playing it to him I don't know about United I just don't see me going there this season at all I just yeah yeah I mean Bruno's OB the obvious pick but I just I like I still like garnacho I still think gacho is the one six5 there's others is there there's others when the fixtures turn a bit better he'll be someone I look at but I won't be going NE Bruno 2560 thank you very much for your support I hope it's you're here not to watch me in agony I in faith that you're here just to watch us because you enjoy watching us but if it is for the pain games with six plus off sides do hit the likes and the subs if you're new around here as they say I got a little brand thing I can put on you can't look at comments don't do that what are you doing oh you didn't do the oh you did do the club badge in the com go what have you got we got like the sub thing check out the F blackbox patreon there it is ww. patreon.com blackbox if you're interested in the predictions league and also the other league with some cool trophies which I keep promising photos for at some point yeah okay they'll be with the winners of last year on the Arsenal Villa right what are we thinking back I'm going to Villa look at that at the logo is updating very fancy so um I think Aral win this is Rogers playing first of all yeah so I I made I made a sub this morning a transfer this morning which me was which meant because otherwise I would have had Rogers yeah Rogers is playing I'd be very surprised if he wasn't he was excellent so I've gone two and Arsenal I've gone I've gone two one two on AR so for me would it surprise massively well seem you going T would it you massively if um Billa won this yes because I don't think Arsenal timberin interesting for inen was he okay don't know why I did that why they Zen well I think zinenko is being phased out isn't he they've signed Timber they've got calori coming in yeah um so this must be a decent game so I reckon it's going to be a I think another two one it's a problem is it because like we've got two um you got a game a day of really good game so it's a good day for mat to day challenge but I'd love to have watched this game and I'd love to have watched the Brighton game as well you reckon to Martin Elli is he because he got a 90 yeah in the home game he he started the season quite well started season quite well he's always going to tr isn't he in the wings Lally was Eddie on the bench or was he I want I really want him to be he's him he no he's not he's not they kept him he's in the squad oh hello cash down oh this will be um the young 18 million yeah the four million if he's out is that hamy oh what he's just done his he just turned his ankle isn't he no it's hamstring isn't it no because he he he kind of fell on he fell onto his ankle I think what what his hamstring I thought it was he hasn't gone off hasn't he well they haven't said he must have done he couldn't even walk no he's walking around the pitch now look so they played on without bringing a okay come on sacka yeah come on sacka that's one we can agree on it in I thought it was [Laughter] in I thought it was in did he sa that look like he did Bloody H it was a good save it bounced up in front of him my hand's a bit wild no hat today no I have had it don't want to wear it now I might wear it and pull out of my face for the man city game oh he's got caught in possession Rogers that's a go did you start Rogers no he's first on my bench what's Watkins doing I want to get him next week how did he not score that I don't know Rogers again though looks good does missed big great pass wins it that is Watkins from a couple of Seasons back that's not the Watkins we know now that's the one I can't believe he missed that oh dear he was a bit like that towards the end of last season did he once vill would got that top four he kind of went off the boil a bit makes me wonder whether it's too early to go for him yeah I've got probably bang one in for 25 yards yeah and You' be like oh Walkins I always said he was good is he's going to how long gone did they show how long was oh look at AA going down oh hello hello oh handbags what did mcin do there look like he he's so little what is going on did he try and get his ass in there using his prime weapon if I was M special move ass comes into play I would not mess with CRA and they gonna what is going on to me there was nothing there at all there was like he grabbed his shirt and he faked it oh oh okay he's gonna get done for that isn't he but then mcin went down as if to say he's pushed me was it y yellow from mcin it's going to be yellow for mcin Yow SLE isn't it yeah but yeah maybe the fact they're showing it means there's a red later didn't show the good this isn't a great game either it's halim and it's nil nil yeah we got shortage of goals Rogers oh he's so he is so good look at this oh oh my God good hands from R well done good hands oh you got R yeah I'll be annoyed if Arsenal could get another clean sheet because I nearly went for R Rogers though he's going hit hit a ho yeah second half I tell you what then there ain't many goals are there I mean Spurs Everton might be quite low scoring goal Jesus I was hoping not why did they even show that incident because it wasn't any cards no it was weird that was a bizarre thing to show he's everywhere is he oh oh R oh it's going to be in oh my God what a save what a save what a save that is had a brilliant start to the season right hasn't he bloody hell there was that one last week did he stop that one as well oh my gods that's Watkins from about what six yards out Watkins should have had a brace did he touch this did he get a save I don't think he did no no he's don't it oh why does he hit me I don't know that's two cities he's missed is it place it on the right if Aral get away with a clean sheet here they'd been fortunate that's an hour gone still no goals would you take this rare clean sheet blank for oh he's in oh what's happening it's a game of Miss chances what a weird game is this there quite there is there quite a bit of action but what are they doing they're playing the way oh they're going to score here they're goingon to play their way out beat the press and score aren't they is that Anana is good is he he's not getting anywhere with this oh that's a fou oh get up pulled back get up why why are they even showing that as a highlight though so they can then show this no he's off well I don't know what to make of this on Watkins off at 65 that's interesting it has he put dur on again then would you risk Watkins no there's Eddie on the bench no I'm not going to get Watkins next week then not if he's going off on the AR that's two weeks running oh is that save again no you just let it go wide that's coner D coner Winks D coner Winks the Mantra was that going in no he didn't stop it is this going to be nil nil second game of match today nil nil can't be there's going to be a winner I don't know who it's going to go for it looks like a very even game fer oh God fer again that's nice get the assist that's lovely no goal oh who TR TR yeah no it's no assist for that I don't think it's trossard nice go that's that's a little sharp shot now I love TR hard was there assist I don't think there was an assist because it looked like it no it kind of can it canned off didn't it the defender is that H's in the middle yeah he kept it on yeah it's definitely on yeah Rogers kicked it kind took it off him yeah okay oh interesting guy does it end like that it's looking quite Arsenal Now isn't it I said two nil didn't I you did say y v should have scored one oh yeah sacka going to come out pointless no he's going to get an assist that will do nicely good who's called that pte pte okay that's a meaningless um goal scorer for FPL but you're doing right so if it stays like this I've done well CU I've got Pedro Saka and Rea let's see if it does stay like ah I should have got Raya that was an easy one I thought this game particularly what Villa would score in it but Bri next for R yeah the Mighty the mighty SE go yeah at home Tim's coming off they could still concede before the whistle but it does look as though Arsenal going to get that one does isn't it they look good oh look at that oh Martin over the oh it's quite a few OD guard owners I had him I had him in my first draft I think oh they can still break here if they don't get one oh what's happened here wow they got caught open Gabrielle's got to bring him down great tackle wow great tackle wow I thought it was Gabrielle that brilliant he's I think R saved it as well like Al didn't like him get set him on loan everyone thought were gonna sell did he get the shot in yeah did save it get save point I don't know that's got to be fre saves luck he did yeah is that R is that Ramsey what a save two nil said take that what did you predicting the Brighton game don't know two all was what two1 two nil uh no two1 yeah ah two bloody clean sheet so far this is a good start maybe is going to go my way as cuz I Gordon and Henderson over a 65 and rare should have done the 65 should have done the six5 and rare that is some save this one wow that's two weeks running he's done well he's made two really good saves reaction saves on his line fair play but when Watkins should have Buried one of those two ches so City next right surely I haven't seen anything actually they nor come up with where it is oh yeah it has a little thing in in in yellow they must be doing quite a big analysis on this we got 2,700 people watching live hello to you all thank you for joining us thank you for joining us so far so good which is not what I'm used to yeah I mean has none of my players have really played well none of my players have played yet because I only had I had sacker in this game that's it it's Tottenham Everton next is it what's City gonna be then I can only think it's such a routine because if it had been if it switch put up a fight been on by now yeah so therefore it's going to be like a routine it's going to be two or 3 n which I think is what we expected anyway yeah um which hopefully means there's goals in TOT if son if you get a goal if son gets me something I am in a really good place I've only got porro in this game all all my all my points though are supposed to be coming from like Mata Smith row Robinson oh yeah we haven't full them yet oh God yeah I've got you got Robinson haven't you and Smith row yeah and mateta Henderson I wouldn't mind if if if Fulham can win two-nil and Palace can win two-nil that'd be great I've forgot I've got Rico Lewis as well if Rico Lewis is playing he better not get dropped did you see Walker posted the um the piece of art I don't it was a program cover and had him on the cover on the front had Walker on the cover yeah so everyone was saying our Walker is gonna get record now and he might they might be right there is absolutely no way the graphic designers I don't think so but it is a bit it always does get people talking doesn't it like oh well he's on the front cover of the program must mean used to last last week why would he play Walker is Walker not needed for that game surely I wouldn't have thought so because Lewis is better going forward and doesn't need to stretch the width right he'll he'll obviously start next week at West Ham I would imagine but oh look at that got caught how does he not see it happened in the first game you said didn't you that wol should have scored for the same reason they got caught a couple times two clean sheets two clean sheets been quite for I think it has been very fortunate Rogers played well again I thought from the highlights he's going nowhere hopefully he starts scoring points next week I got Lester they on your bench he'll be playing next week he's gonna have to I'm gonna be tight for an 11 I need to get I need to get him in someh but I don't really know who to bench I've got quite a quite a strong 11 in on paper Smith Royal Rogers reminds me actually I've got to get rid of salanki tonight so don't let me go back to the hotel you haven't got to you could just take the I can't take not one I just not in my it's not in my nature talk take a not one are you going to get well it depends if munes looks good probably moonz but um the other candidate is wher because they've got santon at home and he leftfield yeah he's a differential so I might as well go for a different were awful aren they yeah I know but I only need him for next week I had a look yeah true I only need him for the one game week and then I can my squad you know I'm strong enough to not play it so it makes me think maybe I should exploit it and go for whist as a differential I don't know munz is the obvious one yeah I I very nearly went for him I just looked at having two full them already and thought yeah that's what I worry about well let's see if that let's see them today I mean they're not on hav been on yet have they Spurs Everton I went for 4-nil Spurs which is not going to be because because obviously I would have showed that earlier I think I went three Three N Spurs um guaranteed Everton get a get a goal I'm I'm interested to see ion's lineup haven't got any players it will be um it's uh O'Brien isn't it O'Brien O'Brien come in and hogate right back I guess yeah you could play O'Brien right back and who's the other Center back because tarov is out isn't he if he is out it'll be Michael Keane yeah Keane and O'Brien oh I've heard good things about yeah haven't seen where did they sign him from uh from uh French Club and I can't remember now okay not heard of him yeah that that is that is the graphic isn't it that square why would you not hit the ball there he's got to score maybe maybe the theory is he's trying to headit it back the way the thing is right he's going to shop very high on our exg tables probably Watkins because that's two really good chances so without having seen this we'd be like oh good chances it's not the misses that worried me it's the fact he went off on the yeah yeah so it's like he's got Lester next week I don't want him going off after 60 Minutes against Lester do I so I don't know whether that's a move I would do because I have to take a hit to get him who have they got next Lester at home Lester away Lester away okay yeah I think he's a away I'm gonna but if son gets nothing in this game I can put on my next then son is gonna go down in price let me know if you're enjoying the logos it helps on this I think it helps kind of know which game we're going we're going into um for anyone just tuning in we are currently watching Posta cogo and now grandp Posta salanki and now uh parro's goal Pedro porro 29 is on the screen Cooper how you feeling you must be feeling you must be feeling better better yeah so you had return to all you players so far Pedro goal Ry clean sheet yeah sacker assist yeah and I've had one player play so far and that's sacker assist if son gets me something I'm very happy but we'll see J he's up front or I think Ki is going to go up front Vicario porro that's good because otherwise I'd be getting Ben Johnson Off the Bench I'm glad he's there is playing playing so son well on the graphic they're saying son up front I was not expecting odbert to be in the starting well if he was then Dixon who's he who's Dixon obviously R hogate like we do presumably youth player I've not heard of I don't thinkgate he be being added to FB tonight that's a por turn to be nice wouldn't it right come on Sonny play he is playing down the middle is this this could be good this could be very good for you oh that was a chance he should have gone for that Bren is that por y go on bre go on B po Kulu running over to stay that corner that's interesting now hold on Kula is playing in the 10 there's no Madison yeah he is Madison's on the left what's what's the formation then he's got Brennan why kud on Corners though I still can't work out what formation they're playing so Madison's playing anesi oh Romero oh that was an assist by son as well yeah you're penalty oh no penalty oh my God what is going on it's a bit Scrappy is very Scrappy or is gonna go through is he [Laughter] yeah now an assist yeah that been that was that was a nice bit of play actually son to Romero what is Romero doing there was that he did this yeah he did this last season didn't he he stays up yeah I had him for a few game weeks last season towards the end and he did nothing B kept scoring was horrible come on go get something out of this playing up front I got to get something odar straight in the team odar he's playing well yeah nice oh that was great corner on the corner he is a good player interesting that kulu's on corners on that side when Madison's on the pitch because he was taking all the corners the last game they're playing two 10 behind son and two Wingers it's really attacking would you against Everton interesting that was a weird touch wasn't it Sonny far out son very far going to do anything with that play like the number eight back to him now now go on Sonic go go on that's [Laughter] in what a hit he would that's a great save he would have got that that's a great save considering it was deflected come on just an assist s looks very cool isn't he cool guy yeah I can't believe he's injured already annoying oh Madison mad got a score England play up for grabs no B it is this GNA be nil nil can't be they're absolutely all over them M come on mate it's not going to be 40 is it good touch and F over pigford's got about four saves already we've all been there mate we've all been there it's all 14 14 minutes oh my God maybe it is going to be 40 I thought the second bloody hell this is nice ref ref ref come on K give it Sonny oh what is he doing he's gonna hit it oh good go finish wow a doggy was it yeah lovely it's Puma oh it's Puma oh sorry yeah because he's in the side because um theyve got very similar bentle is not playing is he bentle got the concussion so Mar mign B great player for us so kulo assist there I think is it kulo assist no it's not is it it is assist K assist great um yeah he was a great player for us Sam still got kesi she was uh I don't think you a lot of people have sold him right after the benching well not with salanki out maybe yeah true yeah good point right one n nothing for son not yet only 25 that flashed up at 14 minutes I thought blim is an hour gone at least Dix I just realized who the ref is so who is the ref it's um thingy it's the uh the guy who always um good gives a penalty isn't it good analysis Mark trying to think of his name now got go on go on Sonny go on oh got to be yeah that's terrible wow that is terrible that was terrible it was ter terrible terrible well done Jordan what did he do there then what did he do is he trying to dwell on there my God Mark you're having a good match of the day challenge I am at the moment I don't like this yeah well harand could ruin it though could he that is terrible oh my God whatever I'm happy about it but my go pford he must have seen him coming in there'll be a lot of people I think who still sold son for foden right yeah Anthony Taylor that's it so I couldn't remember the rest name he normally he normally tries to steal the line like by given a controversial decision so let's see Everton are going down two G son's goal means that harland's got to do quite a bit of damage now man you've got Salah all you all you've really got to happen is Salah matches Harem right anyway so yeah so you know he can get a brace now and I should still be all right I can't believe that go for he did well to to he did he did to well he's a clean sheet gone Po's clean Sheet's going to go oh boys what are you doing oh good sa get in get in don't fail it free kick thank you Anthony po gonna get a clean sheet that' be be a turn up he never gets a clean sheet that's poor that that was a doggy wasn't it it was Keystone Cops Bend IN AR it they all in it's very hard to tell the difference between a doggy and Puma from the back they both got the same hair KES off on the left or son down the middle here he can still get me something out here but I'm not going to be greedy I'll just got your one goal must be take the goal he's exactly the person you want if the goalkeeper's GNA fumble that or slip up son is about the best player you want isn't it to be on the end of it oh three is that Romero yeah maybe my four maybe my 40 is on where where was that when I owned him last season oh what I wanted was a nice little header Madison assist clean assist straight to him no I don't think there is everon oh there is Everton getting done on set pieces I guess without toosi and yeah they look bad Everton that's two three Nils that's two three Nils they're not they just haven't got the squad have they got the players like Calvin Le what's Calin lein done this game keep it clean though Spurs hold on is this gonna be the fourth go on Son's in son's in give it Sonny give it him what are you doing vanderin I know you're quick but give it him give it him go on son go on yes [ __ ] hell I'll take that I'm swearing ining I thought he wasn't going to give it him I thought he wasn't going to give it him I don't I don't I don't like you happy this is too many points dear me this is too many points this is everyone returning two two goals and Max bonus of son God I hope harand gets five every one of my players so far Holland gets five is my only look at Everton and I said 40 called that as well Everton going home right all right getting a very big for your now this is this is extraordinary set of events two goals for son yeah right happy I am I'm GNA be taking lots of hits tonight if this continues because I'm just gonna be spending the point I can't get rid of s now can I well i' I've had two players played I mean the logic says I should still I've had two players play I've had two returns I've got to look at the positives despite you getting every you should be enjoying my points H well we are sort of a team but I also don't want you doing that well I can't have another season where you beat me by like har could still piss on my chips that's not the wrong that's the wrong anergy isn't it no that's right r on he doesn't look happy now it's four and he never looks at the camera look look at the camera he was so full of joy yeah I know he just looks down at his feet at all times he never looks the the interviewer in the eye does he did he what did he do that when he first joint I'm pretty sure he didn't I'm pretty sure he was he was happy as Larry he first joined but he's had the English media knocked it out of him my Wine's in Mt if my assistant is why watching do reckon you could bring me some wine I really thought vaner wasn't giving him that oh City up switch next yeah here we go it's all GNA go wrong now so if he gets if he gets one that's a result that's a big result two got two goals for Son Two yeah son cancels it out did did you unless he gets a hatrick or more consider captaining him son yeah I did I did think about it that would have been I'll take it he's obviously a major differential so yeah he's the Les he's the less owned of all the premiums isn't he so but he's not going to go down in price now well that's the key thing knock at the door oh that is that is the extra bottle of wine in other words Mark probably needs it because it's Harland up next well good service good service maybe I was right maybe the the people cheting in are just cheting in to watch enjoy a match the day challenge one I have swarm I said the FB oh yeah we demonetized is that demonetized it probably that's right it's worth it it's fine we're not we're not for the money how hot are they on that kind of stuff because remember when we played the um copyright music they found it straight away it was it was remember when fbl Pig was doing yeah oh yeah these songs and they ped the tune sounded a bit like it straight away I think swearing's all right to be you swear all the time you got a filthy mouth on Black Box these days I don't I say the s word do you see um slot said [ __ ] in the you can say that one can't you I don't know I think the are what what is it number of you get number of strikes in your out um I have no idea I'm sure you can swear can't you there's be loads of like I don't know as long as we say it's not sortable for kids but we've drinking alcohol as well so oh yeah yeah should know by now it's not I always get confused with that notification because it say super for kids but I it's not it's it's made for kids is how they phrase it right and obviously we're not making the stuff for kids also they can watch it if they want so they can't with your potty mouth no I am I'm terrible you know what I mean though you're like this content clearly isn't made for kids but also he was lucky to score this Sonny though went through his leg doesn't need like an 18 plus rating most of the time does tonight right now now the uh now the screaming starts I really really really need harand to go off oh what I care most about this season R Lewis in the team first of all that I think it's beating you I think that is what I care about most this I think so it's not going well yet but early days if Rico Lewis starts and City keep Pedro and Son all returning yeah so far Jesus okay and sacker assist but that's nothing here we go this is where it all goes wrong logo change look at that first I want to see Rico in the team you can't have it all who's first who's first bench here um Rogers I'm also really interested how Fen does in this because you were going to you always playing there he is you were always gonna do s was G do s foden yeah I was it was Young's red card wasn't it that swe you against it as soon as I saw ever and had no defense I kept on one Edison in goal feel sick aangi di guol oh I don't want to watch this Lewis in Midfield with kov yeah but is he in Midfield oh my God no foden svino Silva de Bry I was right I was right got away with that I did say he would only get an hour I didn't think he wouldn't start though where is he's on the bench I'm surprised at that oh that's gonna burn a lot of people no not many got foden did they I think they would have done if you didn't have Harland you would have got f smix is starting that's a change yeah so two changes okay so hold on Lewis is Lewis is playing Midfield he's not 1 are they playing three at the backat then yeah what if L gets me something then I'm done but here we go here we go number one for harand bang in it goes oh G Holland no he miss it okay I'm I'm looking for the clock to be on like 89 minutes honestly one of my that's one of my highlights of match today is 14 minutes they had about six chances and it looked like oh the half's nearly over and it came up 14 minutes it's Hutson gonna he looks like if Harem blanks and City keeper clean sheet that's awesome that's offside surely it winning see what I don't understand is why wouldn't they put this match first Ben Johnson assist oh my God I if por missed out I got he what what I don't understand is why wouldn't they put this game on first then made a game with it Arsenal isn't it I mean that was all right but is it onite is it onite yeah yeah he is he he looks way on side oh my God how do how does City always manage to conceed this type of goal what is ederson doing there though he's always conceding not save that that's a team shotga saves that that is a team effort and he oh that's my clean sheet gone what a terrible game right anyway anyway here we go that's going to really piss off city now Holland Lis hlo Holland's Really Gonna gonna Bang Yeah it can't be like it can't stay low scoring because still do say why they Haven put it on sooner though Savio oh pen there we go there we go is it just outside the area don't know I love it when they go like that no no no it look like I haven't seen this ref before um look like a pen to me it looked like it was in the Box nah no maybe not I saw white from the line yeah that's a pen that's a pen he's in the Box I don't know who that's a pen is the lies a pen it's a pen yeah yeah it's a pen right here's the first one he misses this you're gonna be unbearable I can't handle this if he misses he won't miss it why am I nervous he won't miss it there go on that's one come on it's coming 12 minutes as well 12 minutes should I should I have triple Captain uh well you want more than one if you are going to Triple captain that was a pen I can't argue with that was down the pen again though like you don't really deserve oh my god oh he gifted him oh that's so bad that's here we go Rico assist is it no Savio oh God so bad oh de it wasn't harand de Oh I thought it was har you thought that was Harland yeah you you you coped well I thought that was Harland yeah I'm being calm you were very calm yeah I mean it looks nothing like Harland no I just saw the blonde hair I just saw it could have been Harland I was lucky he could have taken oh Kevin Kevin took it off his toes that's M though Mich does this he Sao did very well there though m is he's meant to be distribution is good but hit I know it's all right I'll get another one don't worry you'll get another one it's not going to end with just one goal is it and that's 16 minutes look at this is that 16 yeah 16 minutes here we goes look here he goes he's gonna he's gonna ruin everything for me there we go it was going so well 3,000 watching three goals three goals in 11 minutes it's turning into what I thought it was going to be so I would take the triple captain now two goals even at this stage and there's still more to play at this game I think you'd be delighted with this what is Mich doing oh geeez oh this is going to be awful is it it's gonna be at least a hattick oh Mark no it was going so well no I mean son no oh Rico what a what did he do did he not score was that not in oh god oh that would have that would have made it so much better was that not it no he didn't go in oh oh my God what's going on why is this game not higher up I don't know mu TW mu was just looking at that this is I no idea why they put this on now this is so exciting maybe the order of match today doesn't relase can we see the RICO Lewis one again I don't want to see how did how did he miss this I don't know oh he's got to score it hit the defender and then hit the ball he's got to score that he hasn't he he'll be dropped for that I'm sweating oh no no no I don't want to watch this no no no no oh I should have triple Captain abely this would really have added to the fun of this pain of it I noticed the the viewing figures went out the minute yeah they did I can't believe it scored as well I think I'll be all right he can probably get another one yeah yeah it won't be a disaster cuz son saved it isn't he son has son's two goals son's two goals and bonus will be beating him at the moment but if he gets another one that's what you get right when you when you sp the har funds around get better no way would I have S if I had har no way so at the moment it's probably even the minute gets this one A J well done I'll take it all back take it all back what a save that is yeah that was a goal I that was easy goal yeah gundo coming up gundo for that be Lewis off would it I would have thought so yeah that' be the last time we see him in a city shirt oh no okay okay don't really understand that taking two I'm not gonna play Lewis next week anyway I didn't but if he' scored that you'd be Hing him so 88 not much not too much in this half then that's it then we'll take that we'll book it two two goals and a bonus that's fine some would have matched him go wo oh no no [ __ ] that is Peak match of the day Peak oh I love this game Rico didn't even touch it for the assist I love this game so much it's so stupid can I just it was so predictable can I just say Yelena has been an absolute Saint today we've had such a lovely day really because she's known the whole she kept it poker faced all day made me feel like it was going to be fine and it's not fine it's she doesn't own him and she's been an absolute Legend today so and she's bought me some wine so thank you that's that's bad for you yeah thanks look at the viewers up to 3.2k I mean it was predictable was it I guess yes but I looked at that 88 and thought he wouldn't get the third and then should have triple Captain Mark son saved me though imagine if I triple Captain he got hatrick as long as Salah gets something tomorrow I shouldn't be too badly off but yeah fair oh you're still you're still You' still got returns from all of your players except for Rico Lewis yeah he should have done he should have Bloody scor God hear me oh it's so funny it's the way you biged it up for the whole thing they're like oh it's later and later I'm feeling better better I feel good I feel great two goals I'll take that cash out know really thought that I I thought that game should have been on sooner yeah that was a good game yeah oh de oh well oh that's so funny though that is so so funny should have triple Gap him you've got to stop doing much of day challenges without harand I don't think it's good for you at the moment I think it's still even because I've got Salah cat into to play unless Salah BLS yeah you won't it'll get yeah you might do but as long as doesn't yeah no honestly it's okay is really sa next come on Mata is it pal West next did you triple Captain me look look look did you did you ask did you no of course [Laughter] it oh dear roller coaster how many how many points is a hatrick for a striker 18 you get 48 12 14 no 17 right 4812 three goals three bonus 15 two for the appearance 17 17 points and S would have got what he' have got 15 5 10 12 no and and the clean [ __ ] oh yeah got clean [ __ ] there you go that's fine son's covered it how did if weo scored that I really would have I don't know how he missed that just a bit yes I mean seven I just show 17 from a trible captain is um about as good as it gets right if you can get 15 to 20 points you triple caps in that is you regretting not doing that yeah absolutely of course not I mean it was pretty obvious when it though he was going to do he was going to get something double at least it's it's just it's very early isn't it to be using that's the reason then you gave right so that's fair enough you got to stick to it but yeah we will get my triple Captain won't get 17 points no so probably not notless the doubles fo nicely yeah I should have done it would have been good content but it's fine I'll take the hatrick and he could have had a four if Deb had not yeah I mean it's going to be it's horrible isn't it watching a game about Harland is horrible yeah um but at least he got the hatrick in a week where player I would had I would if if I was watching this and you didn't have son and didn't have Pedro gone off early and stuff would I would have been yeah coming home now probably but yeah the viewers have have all dropped off now they were just there to watch me watch the hatrick it's so funny isn't it I'm still buzzing Bri's from Brian's win yeah oh Forest I got Forest to come yet but it's going to be bom like like I predicted Rico should have come out with some it though shouldn't he yeah well Edison should have saved that and he should have scor yeah yeah he could had he could have had a 15 pointer on another day platy hell he's already on the top seven play he think about getting him in should I was it Billy said when you said you hadn't got him he said to me in the bar you haven't got Harland you must be insane thanks thanks for that content that's Palace next isn't it is it yep you're right though it's gonna be S Neil Forest NE isn't it I think one1 I think I think that score yeah I predicted one I really hope be able to get say a wood goal now she's been she's been great today on the counter yeah this was a bit careless this is just playing them off right but did they try and play them off yeah they should have stay stepped up there oh they did step up there okay fine that was a problem Le Lewis didn't go with is that Small's got the goal oh God that it's a bad goal it was it was Lewis at thought really he didn't go with the runner he'll be dropped next week I still don't really understand why you bought him but well just for this game just for the upside and you can't say he couldn't he could have scored that's never never going to he could have should have scored you can't you can't knock it it was the theory was that he might get on an assist or something good player though I expected him to get a clean sheet though to be honest I right can we just be team mateta M me having Mata doesn't affect you right right just yeah we can both celebrate can live vicariously through okay F maretta yeah Mareta I mean we haven't got e West Ham are definitely gonna win this game why have I got two Palace players don't like them I like them so much last season and now Palace got a team left or they sold anyone before kickoff I can't believe they got rid of Anderson I can only think it was um contract thing and yeah you know but if they lose Allison and gayy yeah and Alis I think a is safe now isn't he his um release Clauses yeah but he must be wondering what's going on I mean any ambition they had to kick on is not going to be help by selling your two well he'll be gone next he'll be gone next year for sure right we probably want a blank for E don't we otherwise that's our rank killed yeah blank for would be good why am I worried about being ranked being killed I've just walked hard and get a hat trick I think you're I think you're all right you're fine you got your captain to play If s gets two tomorrow oh yeah I'm laughing you're fine right switching over to the Palace logo what you reckon here what did you I predicted one all uh I've gone for a palace win to one I think G he is playing re adding okay MOS Mitchell is mat even going to start no yes Edward playing Edward playing behind okay don't hate that it's Wine's nice I didn't think it was tasting so sweet until about 15 minutes ago organic melb I do like a MBE actually I'm just gives me a headache though you stop complaining right let's see what we get here Mata Patrick oh I don't want EO to go go to town do we oh no he's fluffed that what's happening back over the see Mata should have done a bit better though he's normally got quick feet in those situations he's a bit of a unit he is but he's he's got good feet for a big man as Peter K used to say West H didn't look too clever they did they all ran to the ball I wasn't very impressive West they did all right in the second half against Villa but in the first half they were all over the place they considered a goal before Andy and I even got into the stadium did you not get in no consider calling like three minutes that was careless here's Bing he's going to shoot I don't lose a can already Henderson give me give me a bit of give me a bit of time to enjoy it oh good okay right it's just all chill out I'm chilled out not you I mean Palace they've already played you are quite we still we've still got Fulham to come as well we've got two players in there that's that's surely going to be a low scorer then if that's yeah but one nil will suit us one nil Smith row Robinson assist oh oh why they sh oh W on the bench yeah going back to his old Club Waka oh I mean he offers nothing attacking wise but was that Mata then no he's in the Box here now look he's going to get it isn't he oh e should dard that was Mata playing as like a playing as like a a bloody is e gonna have another game where he has like seven or eight shots and gu nothing I mean I don't mind that not owning him but it's gonna be killer for his owners if he hasn't have a game like that Mata is playing quite deep yeah is that him there deep is this Edward to be God you had an assist there it's like it's a stupid game FPL isn't it because like how does he not at least hit the target Dam they're carving them open they carving them open every time I think Mata should have got something yeah I think Mata should be on on something already if Mata blanks and moon get something I'll be annoyed oh Walton Walton's in here's Mata he's going to cost this in he or is he going to play it back he's gonna that's not where he want him is it so wide that is not what you want him he might get taken off at 60 Minutes as well so no he's blowing would he take the pens if they get one take he oh there's e oh he is he is going to have one of those games this must be the record for the most shots have hit the bar or the post in one week surely I tell you what as well when it comes to goals imminent Joe will be W himself over e because he must be well at the top of that at the moment is he not gonna get anything from this again 67 nothing happen in this game maybe it's it's gonna be a one it's gonna be a one nil isn't it either way yeah's out wide again mat doing a lot of running in channels not what you want no he's playing quite well but yeah it's not enough oh dear oh hello they're breaking here is this Waka it is isn't it against his old Club no go on a rampaging run oh no oh that's nice B very nice is's slow there isn't he oh what's he doing oh oh what they oh that's the Henderson clean sheet gone such that was poor was it from Palace because they were that wasn't like a convincing attack and panace just like didn't go back look at this look at this pies everywhere look at these Western fans wrecking the palace ground I shouldn't have penderson and Mata you know when you're watching a game and you're like what's this about what's this happened here ball boy being hurt him just allow the goal what did he do look you're right about eza he didn't look he's there yeah and he didn't track the man at all did he look what's he doing left him look why is the why did he show the ball boy I don't know why is he Hing that that Calamity of er oh Jesus Christ was Keystone Cops at the back clown shoes so bad so bad but this is what you get when you sell your Defenders oh here we go what happened did he oh the kid got crushed oh my God that could have been awful he got hit by like a camera or something no it's the fence fence has collapsed on him jesz that could have been really nasty they going get sued for that they he's all right this another goal they did well to save him out of that because he could have got crushed that was awful eduard off it's going to be one all they're going to equalize EZ gets something surely he can't go another game peppering the goal and getting nothing the views have massively dropped off now here we go here we go 30 y oh I think he looks a bit frustrated yeah he nearly nearly dragged him back there B's gonna be in here oh my God he's got to play this got play this the fer is he he's going to shoot two n no oh dear what we got Henderson yeah Henderson over R it's G well ra on what probably about he probably got eight or nine today he got eight last week he got one 16 17 maybe got one sa yeah one save point that's seven maybe one bonus maybe he could be on like 16 17 yeah I think you got to reink Palace if they're selling gayy as well yeah I mean that was again Runners is the fixes of Palace are pretty decent yeah Runners though they had swarming for Palace weren't tracking back it's funny how they look 77 they can still get something e or maretta could still get something here we go maretta oh oh was wasn't but thank you I appreciate the support where they go well mateta was that was that was that was the worst that game could have gone for me excellent stuff well done Palace fantastic Henderson and Mata another E blank he'll be going down in P next I mean I don't think people should sell him but they probably will because they're getting patient don't they yeah it's a good point 's popular and moono is popular as well isn't he wouldn't to get oh dear that was pretty bad losing two-nil at home to West Ham oh yeah you was he saying I should have stayed at Forest I should should have stayed at Forest F ler next I think that means that um it is Southampton norest last knew it I tell you this is serious like Po kid I mean fair play rescuing him B and such did that he's right that's like shocker yeah what you think to B you think he's GNA be getting our team this year or not yeah I think when West Ham get all their did Somerville come on no didn't notice yeah interesting I mean iil w are a funny team aren't they I wasn't impressed with him in that game but they counted well in this game but Palace had all the seemingly all the chances in the first half some of's fee potentially rising to 34 million they paid 40 million for kilman for kilman wow he a good Defender he's a very good Defender but 40 million is a lot of money so what are you going to do with martesa now I want rid I'll keep him if you munz scores why didn't why didn't you go munz just because you didn't want free F yeah basically I can see the logic but his fixtures are so good yeah kilman walking out our defense well the viewers have all dropped off so I can only think there's no more goals 2300 I reckon no more goals both but we but but as a forest fan I'll take a nil nil Robinson and Smith Ro got double digits we don't see both Mark and as happy could be that yeah we'll do that oh I reckon you're still on more points than me even with harand uh no I can't be no I can't be I can't be har 40 OD points 34 from Harland you've got 15 from son eight from Raya eight or n from Pedro have I got eight from R you got clean sheet at least one save point maybe a bonus a Robinson clean sheet nice here robon clean sheet now verus leester I want vardy like mucking up my full and clean sheet here Robinson plays that's good oh my Ben Johnson no I don't they conceded three goals they I'm glad Ben Johnson Ben Johnson got an assist he did what boy a I should have got mooners that new stand's nice it and he tried an overhead kick in the last game yeah against against United any changes to Leicester team wins indeed so no skip Winks D con WIS D con CH I got V in my draft team so right something for Robinson and Smith row would round we ried on this nice join we can be harmonious for this one it's rare you were very complimentary about mat in the last game thank you well you know I don't want to see you you had Henderson in go as well oh God that was oh aa ad started the season all right isn't he oh my God still that's sa from Hansson yeah he's decent Hanson get rid of hon for him God he's huge he is an absolute Beast that shot as well surely do you Reon like when in midweek training goes what you doing today ad only goes weights just cut you don't need to do any more fraking weights you giant can you do some running yeah ex do some technique training I want to do some more we can you do some can you do some finishing training please I love aat he probably go yeah if you put the baby all on me I'll do that yeah what a job that must be for someone at the club oh he's gonna I doubt he does it himself right he's gonna set up who's that is that Robinson no who is it Smith Row in it it is yes Mark don't leave me hanging please yes well done Esa well done my son I thought it was Robinson no no no it was um it was a Dharma assist uh yeah Robinson is out outside but yeah took it well didn't he took it well he's such a good player look at that Watkins could learn a lot from that come on Smith Road that's nice yeah he's not he's not that highly he is in certain again if you've got Haren you probably can't go to Smith row you've gone Wings haven't you he was kind of ining out my team a bit Smith row as well um cuz I mate for a bit but it was he didn't get today Robinson's cross oh my god munes oh big chance big chance of munes that would have repaid the is he gonna blank I think get is that a big chance cross a big chance created you might get bonus in a clean sheet with that all we wanted was a clean sheet and if we get that I'll be over the yeah like I said views have dropped off that means we might I don't know where the leester goals coming from aart vard don't foul him don't foul him well on good defending yeah he's a good player Robinson always last time Cooper turned up at the cottage 4-0 full and beat forest and that was the game where marinakis thre his pass in someone's front garden they found it the next day we go what are they doing what is that they is that fast what are they doing from the set piece oh that's the clean sheet gone it oh no hold on what's happened he no it's a goal is it it's a goal I think it is what it's a goal what's wrong with it what what's he given there how's that a foul it's a goal that's a good goal isn't it yeah it's a goal what they they G I bet they're giving it for the block what I bet they're giving it no he's gonna he's gonna allow it he's goingon to allow it what were they not giving it for well it's a definite goal it's a goal it's a clear goal it's a goal because but they but they are getting funny about offsite offside where where where is it offside is it a goal the clean that's the clean sheet gone no of course they one there we go goal I thought he might have given it for like a something a push in the box or something not for why would they disallow that don't know I don't know why he disallowed it at first but not fair play it made me think for a minute I was still gonna get a clean sheo fast is coming off a few people's benches he's a four million player why who didn't turn up yeah good point you might do if players don't turn up tomorrow foden yeah foden didn't even come did he no didn't see it didn't see it that's rough have people got face on the bench anyway that is uh that's annoying that is annoying unless Robinson gets something I'm happy with Smith row but still I'll be happy with a moon is blank would I because a load of people oh is he doing there what was face doing there oh my god did you see what he was doing ridiculous casual back he what is he thinking do you think M's just had like that purple patch and now he's just not that good well I've got to make a transfer tonight so what is face doing there tries to do a back Mo has got to score that yeah more wine wi I don't know what to do I don't know what to do a bottle of wine if I sell sank who would you go with Smith's come off now 7 minutes see the Xmen is no good is it Smith off yeah yeah but he's still kind of building Fitness isn't he um I don't know who I'd go to I mean mun has still got that's a good Ball by Robinson if he scores this is an assist got an assist got assist I'm so happy Here's to You Mr Robinson that's a good it's a good ball as well yeah look us look us with our points the hell I didn't think a would get it who called that Bassie no you might even get a little bonus big chance created so far my only play to blank is Rico Lewis yeah and he should have scored my my only play to blank is oh I two bloody Palace so now it's all about forest for moon is is good for us if Forest don't lose yeah it was good yeah if Forest don't I don't like to Revel in other people's Misfortune if Forest don't lose I'll be calling this a match the day challenge success yeah yeah far Des fight the hatrick yeah I mean I'll have to because I've got points everywhere else and I've got to think that not having Harland has enabled me to have ryer to have son to have ESR those are players that people with Harland don't necessarily have I still can't believe wkins and just bury that you be doing this for an hour this is half the length of a blackbox normal stream yeah I'm exhausted oh well I am I was all right until the hatrick that took a lot out me yeah Robinson and Smith R returning though that is really good that's a rarity for these good yeah teams are quite different but we those two were obviously well I've got no one in no one in this game no one no one in this game no has anyone got anyone in the sou I'm so happy I called this the bot the bottom game so Chris Wood y's got chriswood she has and I really I really want what do I do with salanki now because I was going to go munes but he's blanked twice missed we missed two big chances there I don't think I go for munes but who would you get do you really want Moone and Pedro up front no but I don't want to take the slanky drop so I want to get rid I could get wher who's at home to Southampton I did that yeah I was thinking that I do that because he's a big differential trouble is trouble is he don't play till tomorrow are you gonna make that move tonight it's fine well you know what I'm like I'm a Carefree Carefree Maverick Mark you you are many things but Carefree is not one of them care oh you know I'm just so relaxed oh yeah I'm just so chilled out yeah I'm gonna leak our WhatsApp messages one day it's a mistake that's the day I'm canceled me and Jenis will'll be having lunch the next day can we make jenus jokes probably not it's probably too soon way too soon no one's watching there only 2,000

uh in the in the description um join that and there's good chat going on in there here we go I'm nervous about change oh we're in the third kit forest in the Man City kit look right what I want to hear first of all who Forest playing who is Team No the team small bone they're playing a Rebo and not um not C oh they are no they're not playing not playing AR see the argument I got from Twitter about the BR and Diaz headb yes bad he was bad he is a bit of a [ __ ] house isn't he I mean don't get me wrong shov sh shouldn't do it and it is a red card but the reaction Anderson Anderson starting s this is the team I wanted okay I'm really pleased for Anderson starting with sangar that's Chris nice come on Chris oh come on for just don't lose and then then I'll call it I'll call it a success I am team forest for this match go on go on Callum go on get at him get at him he's he's too far getting he's not he's not get oh he's kind of getting a but not no he's got it good ball go on ni was he a good ball yes I think he was trying to play it give it Callum callum's GNA have a go here cide and have a go no this is nice play go go this is where Chris Wood's effective oh should have made more of that shouldn't we what's he doing there he's not shooting he's not Crossing I can't believe McCarthy is still starting for Southampton he's been there for about 15 years it one touch it around him yeah that's nice this has got to be a goal's in it's got to be a goal offside no it's not offside oh oh we're not taking our chances we're not taking our chances that's too two really good chances out wide the only reason I thought it was offside was because there was no South Players back all over them why did he slow down so much I know don't know he's looking for it looks like we're walking at the moment Forest not showing any urgency oh Morgan oh they're going to break on us aren't they this is going too well all over them we're not getting any charges SAR is going to hit this oh is that corable we're not getting anything for this low we're playing we're doing it right we're not getting anything for it still Forest it's all Forest there hasn't been a single s and they at home okay I thought we'd be giving they'd have the ball and we were breaking hit it that was awful that's wood oh that's a shame that's we're gonna lose this aren't we we're going to lose it having done all this how did he miss that was that Chris sangari stretched and milinkovic missed it we're gonna lose it oh I don't believe it well we should be one up should be one up what's sari doing there what Who's down Alena down they're playing on they can give a [ __ ] they they don't have to do they they're going to score aren't they oh I can't watch this is really annoying it's okay I'm here for you they're going to blood we've had all the play if he was clutching his head should do shouldn't he that's what they should do oh good save that was easy yeah even mat saves that yeah but you've got so many goalkeepers you know we only all one in the goal at any one time we tried that last you never know if your goalkeepers if they're going to save something like that well this isn't much of a thriller is it this is gonna be nil nil I'll take I'll take a nil nil to be honest but to be honest now we're attacking we're the better side come on Chrissy oh my god oh good defending yeah it looks like we played all right you've done like easily enough to be winning this game yeah that's why it's annoying I think you got to score from this corner F don't pose any threat from got score Nico's gonna shoot or hit our own player and then they break on us no no he's not giving the foul there Callum morgs that's in he's in that giv W yeah yeah fair play a few would have had him maybe yeah yeah we deserve it though because we've been the better team from what I could see here felt to him nicely didn't it I thought he was going to miss it he took the yed was right and then yeah s yeah nice now what do we do now do we keep the's got Gib isn't he don't know yeah I think he has yeah he was the Inu alternative wouldn't he for me he the best six I think I think the first three he was the best 65 they're the best fixtures yeah yeah we're doing all right we're on the break again go on Anthony run him just run him you can you got him for Pace that's it go on go on do well a straight the keeper really poor should have crossed W wood is there like why haven't you crossed why hav you just pass that's a trouble Langer all he has to do no but that's that's a trouble Langer like his end product's not good they're going to Nick also that's the whole reason you have wood because he's not that mobile but he gets into those positions you find him wood off sorry annoying don't concede don't concede don't concede don't foul don't foul away oh Jesus we're hanging on aren't we typically oh that's right that's poor that was poor I'll tell you what if we take it one n I'll be delighted I will be delighted with that yes so win for Brighton win for Forest crazy amounts of points for your team that isn't harl but I also got my we've we've both won I think from this I I'll take that as a win yeah if Salah Salah just needs to get me something and then I'm fine IM mat of the day 23 attempts to five for Forest we had 23 attemp yeah yeah well you played well there look good you got fit look at that 2.31 0.20 they got that's it right that's all the games that's I mean you gotta think Sant in trouble if they only getting .20 in their first home game yeah but we always knew that's the thing Holland's Got s at home in game week n that's another Triple C not sure son can dig me out that one again we got our points uh 1,600 comments 2,000 people watching live I'm going to put on the comments and say Hello uh to everyone uh I need I need to turn my into open up the chat Richardson airplane airplane everyone great to see you all we have no idea if this is actually good content by the way so if you have enjoyed it 63 I got if you've enjoyed it please do let us know in the comments do give a like as well and subscribe to the channel um I've really enjoyed it tonight yeah it was good it's been really good good and for once I don't feel like I us have really lost badly out of that yeah you done well class stream says Fergus Bolton Andrew W awesome stream I mean he had to get the hatrick didn't he too many fils congrats both lots of points for both of you thank you best stream of the season so far Defender art it's always nice when you actually look at the comments sorry about the F bombs sorry about that and have fun emotional roller coaster as everyone I mean fair play to anyone who did that with us it was it's hard work I can't say it's not easy especially when your team are playing the hardest thing is watching Forest to me and we can get I I set this up so I can I kind of expected Harland to get big score but perhaps not as big as that if I move this screen over here and then I go over here hang on I got a green arrow so this is a good one from Ron waffles loved it could have gone South if Mark had left as hanging yeah I was like this I was like this you you oh fod wasn't even in the squad oh wow that could have been a disaster I done that trans R got nine yeah nine so he's got an eight and a nine that's a bad that is a fumble for me not getting him that is a real did you have to go without to get him though I've got Gordon I could have done Gordon to a 65 Gibbs white and Rea yeah but you know you know the six five I was most looking at um was sabosa yeah well he might get something tomorrow I know uh as 65 Mark 63 yeah but I got my C so I just need I just need something from Salah I mean I'll take it as it is I mean it's a good game I think come out of that for a green arrow a harand hatrick and I still got a green arrow got Del i' Got Away of it big time let us know let us know if you did play the uh the TR Captain this week as well if I press that and then I go to present what you doing now I'm going to share share your screen I'm kind of learning my way around streamyards yeah there we go oh is it and then you add us back in I remove I just remove that yeah I D back in can't do it I thought it was this one that's got my screen why it why is it in that box you got to take the overlay off because the overlay it's basically the first camera goes in there anyway it doesn't matter if it's in there people can see it what you get 60 uh 65 got left to play you got J I have got Gordon you're gonna be it's gonna be a good score you got green AR haven't you yeah Robinson six he got a Bonus that's nice Mata two yeah this Smith row got 10 so Andy North Smith R got all three bonus yeah he did yeah Andy North got 72 nice he's got jot Trent and isach to play to come yeah that's yeah he has got Gibbs white so he did very well I'm in the top million Mark I know 900,000 we're both in the top million I'm 699 I surely can't go down tomorrow with Salah Captain as well so well you're going to beat me this week that's fine let's have a look this is officially our best start of the season after two game weeks I think you're you're 700k with Sal Salah to play and Trent yeah Ray nine Hertz So salanki Gone from a red flag to an orange flag that would have locked him wouldn't it I think that's locked him is it yeah because if you go from a flag chain 16 just be I think that would have on 16 yeah they got three bonus didn't he let's let's us know if anyone um triple captained yeah I mean they're the real winners aren't they yeah you must be delighted if you did triple caps in Harland this week um everyone's asking where you're sleeping tonight you've got a hotel hotel hotel yeah we're not topping and tailing as as someone someone asked and I'm just relieved to go back with a green arrow to be honest Oliver Kendall look rukat look at that rukat harand triple captain and a face goal got the F you're right so people did get him I mean like fair play Ian not a bad result Le either Super Chat from Dow obviously love that guys please do more thank you Super Chat D I scored 56 with harand Captain and Gibbs Gibbs white with Pope Salah jotta Murphy and is five to play anyone who says any good at the end knows they've done well and they're looking for me I mean Salah and J could do a lot of damage tomorrow yeah I don't know what to do tonight with salanki I'm gonna check because I think that flag means that he can't go down in price s and sure if you have a status change Jack Bose what harand Smith andon oh my God how's he got harand and probably hasn't got Trent there AR many you probably hasn't got Trent would be my would be my guess uh Mark fos says how hard was it ignoring the scores it was pretty hard I mean it's difficult as I said I on the station somebody had their phone out and then I got on the train and there was Brighton fans on there and they had the radio on but I didn't hear anything and then in the cab on the way here the guy had talk sport on had to tell him to turn it off before I got in the cab I could see it through the window I tapped on said can you turn the radio and he was like you must right weird and I told him what I was about to do and he just laughed and then was talking all about jennice and Lin both i' I it's been the easiest one for me by far of all the how many we done four or five it is yeah it is strangely liberating to go through the day if you haven't tried it I would recommend it once to just see if you like it or not I mean obviously it was well I I will I'll never forget the first one of these we ever did I remember being really stressed and I remember thinking I'm going to go to the tip that's the safest place I could go to and I'm pulling into the tip but they have the radio on i w down the window and the guy was like you're right mate don't suppose you're a football fan don't suppose you saw the he didn't he didn't I swear I swear on my life what did he what did he want to tell you about 9 it was it was the it was um the forino 9 N I can't remember I can't remember what one it was but I swear on Jake's my dog's life the man at the tip tried to talk to me about football and I was and I literally just wound up the window and was and like drove in I swear it was ridiculous since then it's been easier today's been the easiest one by far like I said but a lovely day um at the arcades yels has been an absolute Legend hit that really well I mean if that was me and I knew the scores and and I'd have given a lot more away than she did and it it loued me into a full sense security but I guess she thought because I did well elsewhere I would take the Harland points okay we we got some super chats to answer actually Mark that people been putting in okay uh Mark and as from cage paps Mark and as this is the best stream you guys do Andy from the old group hi Andy Andy from the old group yeah what's you mean by the old group it's Andy from our old group what what do you mean what old group what are you talking about from The Godfather tier oh right right sorry yeah yeah okay sorry one group talking about the thing is Mark I know I know we offer a great thing in our in our god of but some people do leave yeah okay I don't blame them to be honest uh D there we've yeah we we we need to we need to do more than one of these a season don't we we'll do a Spong who I met at Fest oh yeah you wouldn't stop talking to him yeah he is Bor fan and can't sell salanki to Watkins now no well the thing is to do that I'd have to take a hit and sell some which I can't do now can I but he had good chances does it I know he didn't take them but just because he didn't score them no but do I want to sell son to J When J was playing tomorrow and yeah J could have a sting could get injured or anything it's too risky you can't you can't I don't you know what I think I don't think I sell salanki I think I take the I swall the not one but you hate swall the minus one I know I do but I don't really unless I go wher but I I'm not convinced that slanky will go down now because I'm pretty sure Flags change yeah and on fbl statistics he's on 101 and going down tonight but only just look at this Super Chat what's that guy juk is personal 103 with triple Captain harand Maybe har and S was more common than I thought obviously don't have sacka but so you went son over3 after one game you've got to be in the top 100K maybe top 50k Jesus Christ um Muhammad toar great stream as always thank you very much reckon people won't W this what I want to ask you about what your what your plan is for Harland are you just not going to have Salah cuz you just hope J covers it the thing with Harlem Mark is he's quite good think I might keep him for a bit Yeah but it's just a Liverpool scare is it because they got Bournemouth and Forest at home J and Trent though yeah so your hope J stays in that's right as long as J's still starting it's fine if J suddenly drops out then there's a problem and then I might need to address it but for now hopefully I can get away it like tomorrow jot versus cah like obviously you've got C Captain but if it was just jot versus cah I I couldn't say for sure which one's going to get more said preseason that when he's on the pitch he can match Salah but obviously the minutes are in salah's favor and the pens are but that isn't going to be always be a major factor so he could outscore f team says it's only if they go from red to available oh is it he's a very good he's a very good source I I thought it was a change in status so but that's fair enough so yeah I mean fbio statistics have got him only just dropping whereas fix have got him going down massively Mr says get yellow in to say thank you for keeping your yeah come on yeah come say hi I wonder if Billy's asleep downstairs I wonder if he is Oh Billy Southern Billy Southerns is in my house it's very nice and the fact he's still up at midnight will probably mean Social Services being touched on Monday as is Pedro or Welbeck on pens Pedro definitely definitely Pedro when he's on the pitch very telling that Pedro stayed on for the 490 talk about it I was shocked about that they made five Subs had he not five subs and he stayed on yeah slanky going down it looks like so I've got to make the change tonight what do I do as position of strength I didn't as actually bench boosted Vlad Mar Smith I mean qu and Barco they I thought they had done something about the button I thought you you had to now confirm it did you not no I don't know look on the desktop so I let's go don't press it let's go to my get off if I press triple Captain don't do it again I have to I have to I have to yeah don't do that yeah I know but I have to then accept freaking me out stop it but I have to do it right yeah what about venge boost no don't don't tie it I I don't want you playing a [ __ ] by don't get your mouse away but you still have to play I know you do just get your mouse away freak me out it's like you know how it is when you you see people stand on the edge of a height they go look at me that's what that's like for me when I see you triggering for you wasn't it was triggering was triggering for me but it's nice there's a button there I still don't think it's clear enough though yeah I mean that's a pain isn't it s what you ask what look at the at least he got ESR I guess so he got double figures off him but yeah so yeah I don't know what to do with him I really don't know what to do with him well you take the price drop yeah I think I think I probably will because you don't know what's going to happen tomorrow that might mean I need that transfer and I don't need to play salanki next week I've got 11 I'm not being funny about but the the obvious option is not to sell salanki is is to to ride it you you you need tomorrow's pictures surely You' never make a transer mid that's basic I do black box is all about no I I try and say it's marginal games no you said to me once if you got two fre transfers you can be more um I haven't got two I know you haven't so don't do it it's my point you can't sell salanki without the knowledge of tomorrow because if josica go for 30 minutes yeah I'm not going to do that it's just whether I go to vissa but V could get injured tomorrow this is what I mean but you need tomorrow's games yeah I know but I'm going to have to stom at the n one and then hope might be back next week he could be he could be yeah and I haven't got him and I would want him I mean he's a way at Newcastle but he could score in that yeah yeah I think I have to keep him don't I and then or I can sell him in midweek if I know he's not back plume n plume absolute Legend saw you at first so thanks for join black box6 points played in both my games 106 points another harand son owner maybe this was more common than I thought I thought everyone had sacka 106 yeah Gibbs white and Smith row 16k N congratulations wow amazing score fantastic we can't take credit for any of that uh if Bill sponge I don't Did we tell this one if Bill sponge love mat today can't sell sank to Watkins I think you might be right yeah yeah cage P says best stream don't forget the super chat over we're on it we've done D oh TI Taylor gifted five thank you TIY that's really nice isn't it enjoy those if you got those uh and I think we've done all the other super chats so oh thank you like And subscribe if you enjoyed that um we kind of enjoyed it it was a bit of a roller coaster probably the best one we've done in ter Eno the output for us was best one we've done but it was a roller coaster right you got points and then harand got a hattick and we both got the Fulham robt assist was probably the sweetest moment I don't know I think I I really enjoyed that that was really really good and the gives white winner which is I'm Absolut delighted with three points both our teams both our teams won so I don't think we can ask much more um I think we call it there thank you everyone for watching um as Mark said like And subscribe if you haven't already uh oh one one more Super Chat and then we will go yeah uh oh actually before we do that AJ bucko very kind of you to give Mark the comfy chair I know he's a very comfy chair I'm on some weird like he's in the stress thing it's horrible but it is a and Billy Billy came in he said that's a nice chair thank you Billy very nice right Final Super Chat Danny mcmm great stre Lads what do you think about a retro defense rotating four FS going forward those are the days Ana Davis coner I like Davis Robinson Ana Davis coner Hall vaner van and load up on top they're all pretty decent options aren't they Ana I'm not too sure about Davis has got some good fixures though coming up I wouldn't get Ana yet because we got ROM um we got Marino just coming I think an will get the right back spot though so I think he's okay Davis I really you know what I could do I could keep salanki and go Lewis to Davis and play Davis next week so Lewis him one week he got him for one week only got him for that game oh that was a bad move shortly that's right he could have got had he scored that goal he didn't no but he should have done my aunt had my aunt was what a bicycle sh my aun had wheel she'd be a bike um I wouldn't I yeah I I think you got to have Trent we've said Al we've said it before got TR yeah I think again tomorrow we'll get a reminder of that to beon I think vanen and Romero I don't think they I think po porro will outscore them but I I think vanen and Romero versus porro you you still get some attacking threat from them but I think you got to have Trent I think you could have Trent and a load of four FS yeah but I wouldn't yeah that's you don't need you don't need po necessarily so Trent and 45es with but I think tomorrow we'll see again why why Trent really important as looks the spoon that's Leaf Davis that is not life Davis life Davis I think they're talking about the sleeping Arrangements they're not they haven't got the message that I you think I'm big SPO if we were to we haven't really talked about that have we we we just take as it comes basically I I I I like both I Aran with you I would want to be a little spoon can we end this can we can we stop that talk really painful for me say it is indeed thank you for superat it painful for for Nigel what did he have maybe heard us talk about spooning don't know I hope Nigel's okay oh he had he had a he spent a lot of transfer at the end didn't he did he oh he didn't have he didn't have Harland and he hasn't got Salah tomorrow should we have a look at let look at n Nigel is a maniac though with these yeah what did he end up with oh not what league is he in this is the Godfather's League okay is he not I can't remember there's a s there is that him yeah that would be him God yeah that's him now what triple captain on porro is that him it can't be no s please tell me you didn't triple I think it is because he's in the Holly admin group and that's that's he's a holly admin so I think that is him isn't it there's another Simon here maybe it's him he triple Captain he didn't J go back go back to the other Simon because I think as he was in Holly's admin group that must be him because there can't be many in our league why would Simon triple Captain borrow well he's a bit he's a bit mavick isn't he this see is that maybe that's not him cuz he's I don't think that janny's ult I know I think he probably is yeah Simon did do por he donated 100 of Charity oh Simon Simon oh that makes us feel even worse now oh Simon he's gone through that to give it to charity Simon I love you but why have you got steel and richison and delit and I mean there's so many that yeah oh that was like the BBC thing it was a charity thing yeah the remember that BBC video where the nanny came in and set the baby that's what it's like it was just I was coming in to say hi to the stream we go keep on top ofous we love you we we love you we love you n oh that was good thank you for joining us we are gonna stop there thank

everyone welcome to FB blackbox ahead of gameweek 2 and Mark and I are here with our Tails between our legs after some disastrous advice from last week's episode how are you Mark I'm good yeah I think I think the message is that um if you think that we uh hared your prospects in game week one we've only just started yeah there's load to come um yeah sorry about everyone uh for anyone who's who's watching this and doesn't really know what going on uh I obviously were very passionate about a certain uh man formerly inde Defender called Barco uh Mark was very very hot on a not as passionate come on get Balan yours has more ramifications because he was a higher price payer and now is dropped to 4.4 and now people can't get to a 4.5 so I think yours was arguably worse than than my one I'm just saying and we were also both very hot on a certain Ben Johnson who also didn't start so Mark well we're gonna dig into that tonight what else are we gonna talk about obviously look at back at our game weeks Look At Con of Replacements the situation with Barco um talk about some of the transfers that are going on as well because they they could impact our thinking coming up soon um quick look at the um impact of of the bonus Neil did a great article on Scout that so we're going to dip into that a little bit kind of confirms what we thought then we're going to look at some light player data we're not bowling out all our tables this week because only one game week so it's a very small sample but we dip in and see who the top performers are we'll talk about players like Trent matoma Madison jotter in bomo there's lot lots of players to discuss and and talk about our first impressions of those um and then there's a couple of dilemmas I want to touch on before before we hit the captaincy because that's big this week isn't it why is it big as certain match of the day challenge coming up on Saturday yeah yeah that's adding to it but of course lot of talk of the triple Captain isn't there so I want to get your opinion where you stand there because I can't offer opinion because I'm not a Harland owner so I'm gonna ask you about that I'm gonna present some evidence yeah I don't don't I don't wna I don't want to imagine I don't want to imagine because it's gonna be painful if that's what happens um there's quite a lot of data on this I've got some data Rob T one of our friends on Twitter has put together some spread betting odds that really do worry me um so we're going to dive into the capsity quite a bit before we look at our predictions in the new tool that you've been working on with um with Liv and Lee and then we'll look at our teams at the end so quite a light version of black box after the three and a half hours we did last week quite a light as you've listed about a hundred things we got to cover in the next next hour and a half yeah no that's fair enough and we've got 800 watching already which is marvelous oh let's have a look go through some of the names in chat well we've got loads people got FPL yellow Army as was here before big tips lots of people talking about barco's hair at the moment and obviously his move to Spain and how that he might struggle yeah with that we got FPL SWAT happy that you're um let's walk fpl's FPL video is back check it out if you haven't already uh we've got Robert we've got Pete we've got BB Defender we've got bunny V asking if I think Barker's going to have waffles tomorrow he's the that's dial is Way Gone I can tell that for TR we got Phil May in the chat my friend from uni I thought

got on him in a bit let's look back at your game week then as um let's go small should we let's get the team a bit bigger there we go quality looks better well it doesn't yeah yeah well you know I've done some work on it um Talk us through it for the podcast go through it yeah so I settled I was pretty settled after last uh week's episode I think it might even be the same team as I as I presented I was determined not to make those those last minute uh changes but it's henerson in goal um Robinson came off the bench for Barco uh porro Trent sacka Rogers who I watched I thought was excellent against West Ham uh Gordon who was not so excellent in his game against Southampton but they did have 10 men uh jot who scored Harland esack captain again bit disappointed with that and salanki who were a couple of sort of halfish chances but didn't really deliver uh and then Bentley who might be on his way to Arsenal which might cause me a few problems if I wanted to get a few more Arsenal players in uh Smith row and the two the two naughty men in Barco and Johnson who didn't even show up so 65 overall it's a better start than I've had in the last few seasons and I'm relatively happy what's the rank where are you not that matters too much but you know 2.3 million or something okay it's not great but it's not five million no I mean it's it's I think we were like one and a half million each last season weren't we so it's roughly in the same region we were last season um I'll go quickly through mind 70 points uh happy with that obviously when even know Harley I stuck to the team I again I think I did the same as you as don't think I changed this at Fest I think the team I showed on the three and a half hour stream is a team I went with at deadline it was Ry and goal with the eight points porro Trent and Quant we'll talk about him in a minute Rogers son sacka and of course Salah who I didn't captain and I'm kicking myself ja Pedro salanki and isak who was my captain on the bench coner Robinson and Smith row with gameweek two in mind those two in particular um yeah I first I swapped the captain to and from Salah and isach um so much so that I I asked poor Ed to change the image that we used when we went for our teams a few times because I kept chopping and changing and in the end I settled on isach and you know when I look back the logic behind that was the home game uh promoted team and he'd been so strong against in both scenarios last season um but the sending off crippled it didn't it really I mean you can say it's a mistake in hindsight but the sh ending off on 29 minutes just skewed that game completely didn't it yeah it was it was very close between them I think I probably would have still kept it on on esack although I would have been a bit bit tempted and I thought it switch were fantastic in in the first half of that game and it was only when they started to Tire a bit uh we saw Liverpool you know really clicking and we looked we both saw R switch's lineup didn't we and thought Oh God this could be a Ming like Mich not there um the the injuries kind of Elsewhere with Johnson obviously wasn't playing and yeah I thought they they they played really well particular in the first half but then Liverpool's quality just just sha through in the end um you know I've got J J could have had a goal from that Trent um cross that he he put that head of wide he's normally good in good in the air like that so that was a little bit disappointing because he would have matched cah but yeah it's a it's a good start for the sellah no har and draft but obviously it's the big week to come we're dig into Salah and J and in a bit but I want to talk about Quan now so the story was um I was watching the game I was at Forest watching it in the par before The Forest game and I heard with like 10 minutes to go for half time that canato was warming up and I thought I must be a knock yeah Quantum had a knock he didn't play too badly he had that one incident where delap roasted him on the touch line outpaced him and out muscled him then also he lost a jewel in the air to greas of a set p and I think it's those two incidents that slot was referring to um postmatch when he said that the team wasn't wasn't winning jwes and and he singled out Jerel quona um in particular subbing him at Hal time bringing on canate canate played a part in the second half rival I guess what that allowed his Trent to push up further he obviously he won some of his Jews I don't think he was incredibly more impressive than Quant but the change was acknowledged by slot as something that was important so I want to ask you a couple of questions um do you think it was harsh and what do you think about slot naming quo in the way he did I never like that with with managers that that do that it's always been a bit of a bug bear of mine you know the Mourinho the contes top top managers who have done that in the past and these managers aren't always the ones that stick around for years and years and years because they make enemies and then they end up losing you know losing the the support of the dressing room and then go to the next club and they can still be successful you know even if clubs for two or three years but it's considering how long klopp has been there and how I mean klopp would never have done that no and you know you can say what you want about about clot but in terms of that man management he was absolutely top top tier probably him and Ferguson are the best of in that i' I've ever I've ever seen um so I think it was harsh uh you saw quon's face when the goal was scored with all the all the subs celebrating on the bench and him looking kind of stone-faced I don't really know where they go from here because is it now just a case of anytime there's going to be crosses put into the box now qu is going to have that doubt around him or is does slot trust him again in one of these games and it's kind of W under the bridge I don't know I don't know the relationship but there's a definite risk and it's a definite sell Mr Lucian saying slot never singled him out I think he did I mean I I took what he said as I mean he didn't name a series of players he did say that Liverpool weren't winning jewes but he did particularly mention Quanto I mean and there's no question like you say as Quant wasn't happy when subbed at half time you could see it yeah I mean you you you ask a question question about not about why why the sub was made and you say you're not winning Jews how is that not singling yeah out that is that is literally what he did he named him he named him yeah um and so I I guess what he's doing there is is he he's setting his stall out and showing that he's not he's not going to take um you know but bad performances I guess and he's going to react and he's going to move decisively I mean like what that means for Darwin remains to be seen because we've seen halves of football where Darwin has missed guilt his chances is he going to drag off halim as well for that we to see dar's not in the team yet that moment hasn't happened but it's um yeah it's an interesting chain event obviously quite painful for me because my first thought was well I've missed out on the clean sheet I didn't think necessarily until I heard the postmatch that cona was going to be a problem but then obviously because I thought it would be an injury um because I didn't think it was that bad but then obviously now we had the the the price drop suddenly just accelerated and it was he went down on Wednesday overnight now I did make the move and more on that later what we've got on the screen here is is Scouts um list of potential Replacements we've got Anthony Robinson of of Fulham as we cons to of villa life Davis of itswitch Yim Anderson soon to be a Fulham I think he has officially today uh Maz ruy of Manchester United he was a star in gameweek one came away with nine points and the maximum bonus and Howard Bellis and mosca who um kind of in particular hit the headlines for some of his Antics at the Emirates didn't he um out of these players where would you go yeah Robinson's the obvious the obvious pick I think out of these given the fixtures fullam have got I've got him in my team happy to bring him in and the idea was to play him in you know four or five weeks there's these you see the rumors around the Manchester United wrist injury well the wrist injury as well there's nothing in that there's nothing I mean I I say these things very confid and I've been wrong before but I don't trust you know no disrespect but an account with 400 followers tweeting injury news when there's nothing else from any press it's my general um rule not to not to even give that any any thought if it comes from you know an account with established follower basis or you know a known account that's got things right in the past fair enough but there's too many idiots around posting fake news as there is all the time and I've been caught out of it before so I I I don't I think the the transfer news is more interesting given the transfer windows open again I don't think there's there's necessarily anything in it so he'd be the one I'd go for the issue is is that if you've stomach the price drop down to 44 and you haven't got money in the bank and you still want to move him out this week you're gonna have to move down to one of the two options that we've got on this list which is har Bellis and and mosca right because you're not gonna or Greaves I think Greaves is the other one at for million um I was very impressed with him against Liverpool he had a decent header you know saved he's going to be nowed on rips so he might be the one to to add but I think I'd go Howard Bellis over him yeah I mean I think that I had a decision to about I you know I hate losing not one um I really hate when the value leaks out of your team so I I mean I think I've seen in chat that you there's some talk of well maybe coner doesn't um yeah it's Lennox dbor saying as Liverpool fan I think may still play Home brenford but have most of the born playing from the back yeah I agree lenx I mean I think um there is every chance he will Tony not lining up for brenford so he hasn't got that physical number nine to battle with set pieces are still going to be an issue so there's it I'm 5050 on whether start I don't think he starts not no no team put in more crosses than brenford last season and that was Ma and that was without Tony for the majority of the Season or half the season but the way brenford played um against Palace was different you could see that they've evolved somewhat they were building up from the back and maybe Frank is moving a different way this season yeah you're right I mean set pieces is is still going to be still going to be a concern for for for slot and maybe canate will get the get the nod when I got Kono in I looked at him and thought well I get him for the first two I think he was going to get in my mind he wouldn't get in the Man United game because canate is a better Defender and I thought man united the way he'll probably play canar for that one then we've got champions league and we'll see how the rotation works over that and that's still going to be a thing I think when Champions League kicks in after game week four he's not going to play well he can't play Kady midweek and weekend because Kate is not up to it so I mean we are going to see a pattern emerge then and you know at that point we can perhaps go back in for quono if if we don't if we don't mind using that third Liverpool slot but that was behind my thinking as well when I sold him it wasn't just an all one it was it was the fact that J are impressed and Liverpool impressed and perhaps a third Liverpool slot is better used on attacking player given the early doubt on Quan out of these players yeah Robinson for me um because of the Fulham run let's have a quick look at the ticker and what that means um Fulham moving down the ticker now game with one is out the way but ler itwi West Ham Newcastle Forest a great run of five games three of them at home and Robinson you know he's high isn't he he offers a lot going forward yeah I mean I this is this is why I I I wanted him um I say Lester switch West Ham Newcastle uh Forest I mean he is he is playable in all five of those games and it's why I felt I was able to go with the two four Millions um at the back I was hoping well we talked about it last week I I said barco is is a three I thought we' get three games out of him and then after that it would be complete lottery turns out we haven't even got haven't even got one still find it ridiculous that he's he's off when he's our only currently our only fit actual left back well there it is there it is as um that was the news that broke um 24 hours ago or maybe more than that um and that really put the icing on the cake for you didn't it because well you did Jing hard I mean those Corners have got to be really good now aren't they it it it it did it do you know what I saw the loan and actually it made me feel a bit better about about things because if he'd just been dropped I wouldn't have really or I I don't know it it would have felt a bit B there's obviously been a plan in place to get him out on loan and that's why he didn't start the season I thought as soon as I didn't see him the lineup I thought it's either injury or or he's going out on loan um I spoke to my dad about it I was like Dad did I get this completely wrong on Barco my dad was like no he's been fantastic preseason we all thought he'd start don't you wor like thanks Dad so if you haven't if you're attacking me you're attacking Chris so that's all I'm saying that's it you're taking your dad down with you that's kind of Philip family Spirit absolutely yeah and as soon as um as soon as he saw the news he said he'll be going on loan what's interesting though is other Brighton players have followed a similar pattern like cedo matoma ad dingra all these players have signed gone out on loan straight away it was a thought but I think because that hasn't you know he came straight in the team he was put in into the first team towards the end of last season he's been such a key part of preseason I didn't really see that as a as an option for him I thought okay's he's going to miss that bit of the path and go straight on and and play um but he didn't so I was wrong about that and I hold my hands up and say I was wrong but he is only four million and Sur pitch surely you weren't actually expecting to play him too much pitch Fox are out as well yeah yeah I pra for the title of this stream so I'll take that yeah people think it's don't they Mark is so creative with these titles what a genius it normally is to be fair but I didn't say it's one of your better ones um yeah I mean the Barco thing is hilarious isn't it because I think we were at Fest and I think it was Andy said to me he said yeah if this is wrong as he's gonna be going down with this one because you were time not only on this stream but at Fest as well really selling him and I I was kind of like encouraging it I kept asking questions about him to make you say the statements you coming out with so I made it worse but yeah it was um I mean it was a shot because hinwood came from nowhere didn't he did he get any pre minutes hwood I wasn't I wasn't expecting that at all and I really really rate hinwood but he played it right back for us towards the end of last season and like I keep saying I thought right back was our weakest area so if I thought we were going to make a change it it would have been there um yeah I'm I'm just surprised that Barco was deemed obviously not ready to to play a part in the first team because he's got all the attributes and everything I've seen from him towards the end of last season preseason made me think he uh you know he would at least start the season give the chance to start the season then maybe go from there but the inine see how he gets on a a severe you know they're top side they'll be expecting to play so maybe next year he'll be the uh we've got to watch your advice when it comes to Brion because you had the adinga episode last season which cost you on Palmer now this this season at least it's come early and hasn't cost you too many points yeah I I've I I must admit my my wrting predictions haven't been I did get matoma I called matoma early but unav he did uh yeah unav a dingra didn't go well Barco didn't go well um yeah it's not being and you're and you're you're really shouted about M more than that in a minute yeah well see there you go careful care don't fall for the bright and goggles again um so Anthony Robinson yes exactly um so Anthony Robinson the the probably the obvious boot you can get there now you've taken you you've sucked up the price drop um life Davis I really like with the fixures that they've got um Fulham Brighton to Anon Villa after the city game so if you've got an option for for game week three life Davis is is worth a go um and Maz ruy maybe United what do you think of the United defense I mean we were at the at the F watching the Fulham game they I think n44 XG conceded second only to Southampton in the game week who obviously played against 10 men so that you know arguably say the best defense on show from game we won are you I guess I guess you're going to be like me it's going to be wait and see but are you optimistic that tar is going to turn that defense around are going to be options yeah I'm I'm more optimistic I think than I maybe have been in in previous Seasons I think they've made some good signings I think delict is going to come in and I think he's a good good signing with something to prove um Onana looked confident and now he's had that kind of first season behind him you think maybe the confidence is is going to be there I thought casemiro looked fit again where he didn't really for large spells last season like he looked pretty good and when you think about the chances Philip had in that game there was that T shot from from miles out there was the um mun overhead kick uh and I I can't really think of too many too many other ones um maybe a couple of other small chances but like you say the the XG was was low so yeah they they they did they did well um the fixures are awful though the fixes are rubbish going forward so I think people buying mazeri now you know away at Brighton then Liverpool you know spurs in in in kind of those those five and then two away games in Southampton and Palace I think there's better options at four five I'm getting I'm getting pelons for calling Leaf Davis life Davis we've got we've got I know two people called life who spell their name like that do you yeah I do yeah um you know two people yeah yeah I do anyway Lea Davis then Leaf Davis is yeah um no I I get it I mean I I think that you know it's one it's one game we of data we can't be too hasty on that but it was encouraging wasn't it for United and I don't think the attack apart from Bruno I mean we got away with Bruno big time I don't think the attack will really temp me too much at the moment no I mean Brun had the two one on ones in there kind of an outside of the boot shot which was was a bit poor then almost immediately another another chance he he really should have got something from from that game yeah the the attack I mean you know garnacha came on and looked a lot better uh he he won't be aad start again I wouldn't have thought gacha is way too important to that team and he should have scored the chance he had the pass was a little bit behind him but he still should have buried it and then he if he's coming away with 10 11 points in game at one he's probably the first bandwagon isn't it given that it's Manchester United and yeah you know there wasn't too many other big Halles was there this week it was uh you look at sacka and Salah and I can't think of too many other double digit havs I guess HS of course yeah havs hav sacka and and Salah but too and normally we get like a game week one don't like a cheap player who you know gets gets something quite quite high but the 65 are a little bit disappointing you know will be disappointed but I I wouldn't be going anywhere else he he I think he's a good pick at 65 but again probably not right now so if you're sitting with 44 and you've got maybe a Robinson or a coner for this week do you sit on coner and leave Robinson or a coner so that's going to cause US problems all season I don't know you've you've deliberately got them both in your team just to give yourself yeah well I did have um what would you do would you give would you give it more time or would you move him out har Bellis you don't think he's going to play Sunday so presumably you're going to say sell him on get the four million in if you if you if you need that third Defender then I think you still have to sell but the time to sell was surely before his price dropped obviously that's not helpful in hindsight for people who who've still got him um if you need a Defender I would I would sell him for a four million yeah I'd sell him for for howood Bellis if you've got another player that can come in and you can just bench him I'd probably ride it out and look to bring him up to a four five option in the next few weeks because the four five options all of these are are decent options I think and I'd rather have any of those than than a sampton defender or gavves or someone if I could wait yeah and the other thing is we will see price drops on players that you will want later um for example if Watkins blanks um this week against Arsenal which easily could happen then his price could drop before the Good Run Of fixtures because he's so highly owned and a good portion of those players who own him aren't necessarily going to be looking at the fixture ticket and going oh he's got good fixtures now they're just going to look at the fact they've got a 9 million asset who's blanked in two game weeks so there will be players dropping in price that you wouldn't mind bringing in which can get you that not one back so I don't think it's panicked yet um but four million options could be boosted um because we had uh this move um set the Berg today going to brenford he's a former in Defender from Liverpool he was on loan at Mains last season one of the best defenders or one of the best performers in the Bundesliga last season defensively that's a good signing for for 25 million and I expect him to start for them in in the Freeman defense so who does he start over don't know I mean I guess Collins is Collins is is nailed on I guess it's I guess it's the pinck place I would say I mean Ben Me Maybe I don't I I don't what their first choice three are because they've got options there already so he just adds to that fur doesn't he I remind myself it's I pinen Collins yeah but they've got I Ben me still at the club right so yeah I think he came on for one minute Ben me right okay I'm just GNA go back and have a look at what brenford um back three were it was those three I think that you've named so yeah it's going to be I think it's going to be penck place it's under threat I mean Collins for me is probably their stronger Aya can bring the ball out he's got some pace so I would have thought I mean I think he's going to start it's going to be some weeks and if we look at brenford fixtures we can give it time because um you know their fixtures there at the bottom of the tiger still so you're not going to look at brenford before perhaps game week six but from that point on their fixtures improve so vanderberg could be an option long term if you don't need someone for this week um so that it's good to have enough formula I'm going to be cautious though because you know the last thing I want to do is Big up perform an option only to mislead the entire FB community and face their raft because that would be stupid thing to do wouldn't it as so straight out on loan yeah on absolutely yeah um want to touch on this um we saw the new BPS system kick in um changes as we know for shots on target fouls one Clarence off the line it's what we expected really I mean this is quite interesting this is a chart that Neil put together on fancy Football Scout um and it shows number of players getting bonus before shots on target were added interestingly the bonus shifted quite a lot over the three days because the deadline for locking down the bonus is an hour not until an hour after the final game of the game week so seen quite a lot of shifts over over a weekend of of the BPS and this table shows that goalkeepers before the shots on taret added seven of them had bonus and that narrowed it down to five Defenders went up from seven to nine but the two areas that we expected to benefit most were midfielders and forwards and so it was nine before shots on target added midfielders went up to 11 and forwards seven to eight no surprises then I was I was actually quite happy about the number of goalkeepers that did end up with bonus I mean is not bad and Rya got a Bonus point for three saves which I didn't expect to get very often so maybe we we're overplaying the impact what's your thoughts well I mean I think we said a goalkeeper is will do all right on the bonus if they keep the clean sheet it's ass soon as as soon as they con seeed and you look at Netto made Seven saves against forest and his overall BPS was 17 so he was absolutely nowhere near getting even one bonus you know because that is 17 is like that's poor you're never going to get a B with 17 I what more can a goalkeeper do to make seven saves uh in a match and you know they only conceded one one goal so that I mean we knew that we knew that anyway because we you'd shown examples of that a few weeks ago um but when they keep a clean sheet they've always got a chance but when they don't there's not a chance of doing it so and I think I still think arsenal were lucky to keep that clean sheet wol should have scored one of the chances they had CBA you know giving the ball away it was a bit sloppy and and wolv just didn't look really up for that that match that's what that was my my takeaway from from seeing the highlights they were looked a bit disorganized were really pressing didn't really have any confidence it was about the easiest game Arsenal could have had um but yeah no yeah I mean it was it went to the script load didn't it Arsenal find a way of of getting the clean sheet and whether they can keep the lap over the tougher pictures we'll have to see but yeah I I think it was it was interesting to see the keepers punished and it is what we've got to expect so it really just confirmed you know what we what we predicted and and obviously what um Pete predicted when he did the analysis of last season's data a keeper who makes seven saves in a one match should get a bonus Point yeah or or at least be rewarded by more than like what would he got four points like he should he should get more than four points because yeah that he's he's basically single-handedly kept that as a draw for for uh for Bournemouth it would be nice if like the first three saves were weighted lighter and then if you make a save five six whatever they get extra BPS that's yeah that's it would be a more advanced version of the BPS but it make sense that once you go over fre saves and you get that one point for the free saves then your four fifth and six saves should add further BPS than the regular amount that would be nice that that would mean that in that situation Netto would be so whether or not they can evolve it to that it's a bit more complex bit more difficult to explain but I think it would be more valid in terms of the output result um in that take him two weeks to to put that into effect rather than well I thought we were worried weren't we because we went home Friday night and we had to look at the bonus and it wasn't right was it because um no Zury had I he had the maximum bonus did he is that the way around yeah mouri at two yeah yeah so that shifted um by I think 24 hours later yeah what we've got to get used to this season people saying in the chat it's a bit unnerving it is isn't it and that the BPS isn't settled and you know we're not going to know exactly what our points are until the last hour of the final game it was right on Scout though right like they they had the updated tables on Scout even though um FPL didn't so you can go into Scout you can go into the members area see the match report and then it will show you the full list and then it update because that's how people knew that Mai was should have got the free bonus rather than xery right right I I believe so it's worth checking that if you're interested in doing a bit more bit more research yeah well let's geek out I love all that um well let's look at some data then this is um top level stuff really um this is the top performers as kind of sorted by xgr non penalty per na rather than points I just thought that was a better guide at this point it gives us a bit of a platform to talk about some of these players we've touched on Bruno already I don't see the force nine continuing though Divas no I don't think so you think xery would would play right came on scored looked a handful in that game I don't think Fernandez did a lot wrong other than not score his two one-on ones if he scores both of those it's a it's a very different uh you know outcome and maybe he persists but surely you I mean they didn't zy wasn't cheap was he it was what 35 40 million pounds yeah yeah and you haven't got a fit Striker and your 40 million pound Striker just come off the bench and scored the winner surely you give him the the next game he he starts at Brian doesn't he I would have thought so we'll see Bruno back in a familiar role a bit deeper um and I don't necessarily think that's going to be bad for his output I still I was still surprised about the number of teams that had Bruno at deadline though because he kind of came from nowhere I'd mentioned him on the stream as someone I was potentially looking at at last minute he was heavily backed by review and heavily backed by rap my team because of the XMS and the pens both of the models liked him I think in the end that was convincing people and then there was a general swell of he's 8.5 it's fullham at home the game's on TV and then lo and behold he's in about you know 60% of the teams I saw at Fest and it was a bit of a surprise yeah it was I mean I did a bit of research on um because obiously there's the two Elite 64 leagues now there's the one General set up which he kind of set up with just people he knew and and put them in and you know you can argue like the analytics and grass side it's probably like a mix of both then it's it's been what about six or seven years and it's all changed around a lot and loads of great managers have been relegated and also we've been relegated and lots manag lots of good managers have gone up because there's like a qualifier so it's all a kind of a poll whereas there's also the elite 64 analytics League now which is obviously made up of all the Brilliant Minds who do all the all the review and and optimized um stuff and it is really interesting when you look at the differences in the players bases because I mean Fernandez is is the biggest one he's in 60 he's in uh 92% of the analytics teams in Elite 64 and he's in 31% of the teams in the elite 64 that is I mean that is the model right so that that shows the influence of the model on those individuals because because jota's the opposite J's stronger in the in the elite 64 but weaker in the analytics because the models don't like jot because of XMS yeah sorry j jotter actually is the biggest difference he's in one team in the in the analytics and he's in 70% of the elite 64 uh League um and I'll put this tapable on on on Discord so so people can see it um just it just shows the differences ownership just it's just yeah just like Pedro for example is in uh 78% of the analytics teams and just 25% of the elite 64 um so yeah there's some pretty big differences between between quite a few um quite a few players yeah really interesting um Andy's just arrived slippers has just arrived in chat and asking if Barco will start game week two thanks for the Super Chat slippers by the way if you are super chatting don't worry they're all getting starred and we can hit them at the end of the stream because stream streamyard is very good at that and it automatically stars and keeps the uh y it the Super Chat so don't worry slippers we'll get to you don't worry we'll I like it when when he when he pays to troll us so nice use of his own subscribers funds I think that's it mainstream fluff yeah mainstream fluff mainam fluff I love it I hope he gets a t-shirt with that one because he really really um Trent because he's my favorite player and I love talking about him he really did come alive 1.06 XD non penalty per 90 most of that in the second half including that glorious cross for jot that would have been so nice so nice and then obviously the slotted through ball for Salo then crossed into slotted very clever for um yeah for J's goal Trent was incredible second half low and and although we don't have the defender data he is Miles Ahead of any other defender in terms of extra y on penalty and I'm saying it right now I think this is the season where the gap between him and the other Defenders is going to be the biggest yeah I mean the question marks we had were does slot know his best role does anyone know his best role is he going to start in Midfield is he going to start a right back and I think like you say the first half he was kind of muted in a way but I think Liverpool were and maybe they just trying to you know see out the kind of the buzz of of the ground and then the first game at Kor Road and try and get through it and they did and in the second half so they much improved but his his position did change in the second half he was moved into much more Central areas and that was the key in unlocking everyone else pretty much on on on the team so yeah I think that's what slot's got to do but we know that slot is a more kind of reserved manager than klopp was so we might have spells where Trent isn't as attacking but when he needs to pop up with something he can but I thought it was a great performance and yeah he could easily have come away from that with with more more points yeah and it's interesting as well that you know sabosa did play the 10 that side and we talked preseason about whether Trent and sabosa down that side would Cil salah's attacking instincts somewhat lead to him having perhaps less involvement near the goal but that wasn't the case at all he had four shots on the Day created two chances this shows 0.85 extra on on penalty came away with a goal could have had more with the four shot everything it was encouraging wasn't it for people who have gone with Salah like myself there was no signs there early on I know it's only one fixure that there'll be any issue with the tactics and the system one thing we did get right on on the last episode and the one before was we were talking up sosay right we showed the tactics about him we both um had him in in kind of our top picks in the 65 million bracket and I think when a lot of those ones didn't really emerge he was I think he got the most him and matoma were probably the only two that really didn't right because and kungu and um like Bailey uh didn't didn't really deliver keski was obviously bench BR and Johnson I thought was really poor in that game and he's you know a concern for for owners um yeah I mean Sal Salah was was excellent I mean he he gave he gave old Leaf a a torrid time didn't he left him in the wind that doesn't work can't think of a leaf rated the FR of his life FR of his belief that doesn't work either whatever uh yeah and and he looks good going forward isn't he moella so if you've got him you obviously hold him for a while although I must say I was happy with jotto and the fact didn't even come on um you know makes me think he's he's gonna have a a good run in the team yes I'm going to ask you now I had this question for later what do you reckon it takes before we're fully confident on joso because obviously as we spoke about the algorithm isn't right because of the X-Men so they'll have his X-Men trailing off um but I watched that game and thought if J stays in his team and continues to play his Center forward there is no question he is going to be the the highest value and Most Wanted midfielder in the game but it's a big if isn't it so at what point do you think we can safely say yes that's his shirt now and Darwin and GPO are not going to take minutes off him significantly enough for us to not get him in I almost feel like he's at that stage already well the the front three was so effective wasn't it in in the second half of of that game and the main thing is the pressing that they did and jotter is the best presser of the three of them in that side so taking him out and replacing him with Darwin or gakpo is in my opinion a massive massive downgrade in that side and you know it could even be that you bring one of those in and J still plays on the left because you want to keep his pressing in I can't see a world in which J misses is you know doesn't start two games in a row three games in a row his minutes are going to be managed but a jot playing 75 minutes a match for this Liverpool team pretty much every game I i' take that because xgi is g to be he's going to be oh yeah in in the top five I'd say yeah he's not 9 N after one game but we know from previous Seasons that it will remain high be in the top he been a top performance of midfielders for sure top five like you say uh riy Timothy he says you know once Europe starts I think that's the key I think once we get past gameweek four and we see the impact of the Champions League we can be we can be more certain um so yeah it's it's a it's something I was had in my mind when I sold Quant it's like well okay like you I saw enough in that game to think you know what he he works in that system we know what a great player he is he's him like Trent is one of my favorite players and I always try and find an excuse to get him in so I had that in mind when I eventually decided to sell coner because it's like well how many weeks is it going to take how many goals is it going to take before we start to move that way um yeah and obviously in the algorithm we'll see him review people putting the x-min up to try and get him into the solves because I think it's going to be a thing I think you know right now we perhaps can't commit but it won't be long two or three games more and then that European Champions League kicking in once we're through that then we'll have a really good idea and I think we probably have to move he's going to go up in price I think before the deadline not going to go up tonight but he's predicted to go up tomorrow I think we can take that given he's where he sits pricewise um you know he's at um he's at 75 so it's a really reasonable price for him but yeah he's he's obviously going to be much coveted if he stays in that role who else should we talk about here go on oh sorry go on just well just a final thing on J is that I mean the issue more with him is that when if Liverpool are drawing or losing and they want to shake things up um you know he's obviously the one that that can be taken off and like you saw with sanki at Spurs for example you know Spurs a one all Chase in that game they're not going to take salanki off because they need him and you know richison can come on maybe alongside him but if they want to do something a bit different that's when jotu could come off for for Darwin or you know they can they can move things around so I think you do have to look at him as like a 70 minute player like going forward um which obviously is a problem when you get so much added time and you want your players on the pitch for the whole for the whole game but I still think get 75 he's he's he's arguably going to be one of the value picks of the season I mean that's going to affect our view on Sal isn't it I mean like we look at the we look at the fixtures and I want to I want to extend it to talk about this because you're a Harland owner and we look at the fixtures for Liverpool in fact let's bring up Liam man's Hop On Hop off because that's probably the best way of illustrating it Liverpool's fixtures from game week four thoris home Bourn home walls away Palace away 4 to7 that's a block of games where you need Liverpool attacking cover so J people who are holding J have got a hope that he continues to be in the side in that run and we'll know a bit you obviously the Champions League kicks in after game week four so that could be a problem maybe for Bournemouth maybe for the th game maybe J doesn't start both of those because he has he's wanted for the European games if you if that is an issue as a Harland owner are you thinking of wild card and then moving off into Salah at that point oh interesting question I mean obviously you C you can Captain Harland or you're going to Captain Harland against brenford anyway in in four I mean is close between Forest Liverpool got forest in four Man City got brenford at home but obviously you you you roll with Harland in that um and then in five they've got Man City have got Arsenal and Liverpool have Bournemouth well that could be a Trent Captain for example if you are worried about minutes around that I don't I don't see anything if you've got Trent as a Harland owner which you haven't necessarily but yes true if you but you're gonna need some liverp for that run aren't you of naan Forest at home Bournemouth at home wolves and Palace I think you need two Liverpool players for that right that was my question I would say yeah I I I would say and I think Trent is is getting close to be a must he's going to be a must by that by that stage I agree I agree because I think like I said the gap between him and the other defensive Defenders this season and because I do think Liverpool will keep more clean sheets so the you know the gap between them and Arsenal will be smaller and we know if Trent is in that side and gets 30 32 plus starts I think his attacking returns will be will be strong yeah so it's Trend and one other it's it's Tren and you know jotter if he's getting the minutes Salah if you can afford him or you take a punt on on sosai if we see sign to him over the next few weeks that he's still playing in that attacking 10 role because even that could be quite a powerful double that not many people are going to have but J staying in that team is absolutely vital because if he does and if he comes through the Champions League like say Darwin gets a Champions League or gapo does and Jos starts all those League games people with Harland don't have to move to Salah they don't have to Wild Card they don't have to feel that urge to I've got to cover this with Salah J can do that for them so that could be a big thing so I can imagine people who have got Harland and josa like yourself are sitting there thinking get keeping the team keeping the team for that spell and then I don't have that urge to wild card and and move to Salah Salah will outscore jotter of course we saw that and the extra minutes is going to be the factor there like you say jotter off on 70 means salah's getting you know 25 minutes a game more if that's going to continue and then there P of course yeah so we know I think J's you know if you can use the word cover he's you know if you couple J with Trent that's perhaps all you need if you're taking Holland in that spell so jot is going to be a key player in how the early season comes together because I think many have hard and plan to Wild Card in game week four but they won't do if jot is still in that team yeah and I think the other interesting is is what happens with City because if at the moment we've got Harland and and foden that's it right they they're the two they're the two options in in that attack you've got many more options in Liverpool like we can class Trent as an attacker and then we've got J Salah and Sabai so it's four versus two so immediately you've got less options to to pick in in city so if you're not going for Harland and you're going for sell then that only leaves you with foden unless you're going to go with no man city attack and given they've got brenford at home and Fulham at home in four and seven that seems quite risky to me as well and do I prefer Harland over foden what do I prefer more basically Harland over foden or Salah over jotter I prefer Harland over foden and J that and that's and that's how I set my team up and that hasn't changed after one week no that's fair enough a lot of people saying about J's Fitness and we know that's been a concern in the past and and absolutely um that that's a key factor will he stay fit that's that's big question um we're not talking about Diaz he's ninth in this table with 0.84 extra non penalty per 90 he did impress um my impression di in that game though that he stayed wider and remained wider rather than getting in on the far post like Salah was but it's only one game and I really want to see Liverpool at home to see how they set up there and what role Diaz can play because he was another one that I like of bosly had my eye on as a kind of peripheral Liverpool player if you can say that um who could work his way into our team but I think jota will kill him if jota stays in that team and stays fit then Diaz is not gonna be someone we look at so bosla because of the extra drop in price will be the third attacking asset I think over Diaz if josa stays stays in that tide yeah because I love I love Diaz as a player but he hasn't got that killer instinct that that J and Salah have and so he's he's way down on the list for me out the three yeah I I guess that slot will want to bring that out of him I thought he was going to be more of a fact this season so we you know the jury's still out I think we need to see see the brenford game and see what we get from Liverpool there in terms of whether we see a repeat of what we saw at its witch um with saos well on the role that he plays so there we've got so much there's so much data to get in yet so much eye test to take in but the early signs Liverpool are they're going to be a force they're going to be a a threat to city and Arsenal and they're going to be a major source of fantasy Talent throughout the season of course as we'd expect um let's talk about matoma and Mina um they were the stand outs to Brighton I don't want you to go too too go in too hard on Brion I don't want you to do it again um but I guess you're gonna talk about MTA right and the impression he made he only got he only got 40 43 minutes he went off just before half time didn't he with an injury concussion but he's P fit for the weekend you're expecting big things right yeah an unlucky injury because he was playing incredibly well um is he is he on this list what was his 0.65 chances created in 45 in 40 minutes which is which is obviously fantastic um oh no three chances created in 45 minutes because that's chances per 90 of course yeah the the issue is that gruda is there and Herz has been talking him up ad dingra scored in that game um we've got routa there as well we don't know where he play we think is a 10 but then what does that mean for Pedro who knows um and again I think m is gonna start for us the majority of games but he's another kind of 60 70 Min man um he he looks just really really good though and again talk about like some players can look good like Diaz can look really good but I don't think he's a great FPL asset whereas I'm hoping M can look great and also deliver the attacking returns to make him a good asset um as well but I'm going to be more reserved on him because I am worried about the amount of attacking options that we that we have and Herz are talking about gruda he was talking about him like a child talking about his favorite toy you know he's saying oh he's he's got so much flare he plays like a kid on the streets we can't wait to use him and see him and you know clearly really wants to bring him in and and get the most out of him so I think matoma is is the pick um from gameweek four when Brighton's fixures look really good maybe we'll know a bit more about Brighton's starting 11 but I just can't moma's biggest threat now is Pedro if routa comes in and you know maybe there's some minutes shared on Pedro because Pedro was good for us on the left last season but I just think matoma gives us so much on that side and there isn't really any like for like replacement but then there wasn't with Parco either um but this is a long way of saying I think mat is probably worth the extra million on right up here isn't he one zer1 on this in this table having had the 88 minutes um at good par four shots per 90 so yeah he did impress um and I'm really interested to see Brighton against United obviously I won't see it because we're not allowed to watch it and know the score but I'll see it on Match of the day and I'll watch it back and I think they aside that you know last season we weren't able to go near them because of the rotation this season the early signs are we're going to have a similar issue but I um I really hope not because I think there's some there's some Talent there that could really play a part in our Seasons whether whether that's matom 65 so much competition that bracket Minter is the one I think if we can if we can see him starting regularly he's the one that I really hope um comes through for us um well who else in Madison I think impressed me in the uh in the Monday night game he's six on his table he came out with ex John on penalty penalty of one z0 only got 78 minutes taken off cuz he tired I mean obviously how much as that is he's familiar with those surroundings and he wanted to impress the his former fans or do you did you see signs there that Madison of old is back yeah for sure I thought he was he was the best player on the pitch in in that game you know he was he was dropping deep he was spraying passes his confidence was there I remember he did like a kind of outside of the right pass across right out to the wing I think to to Johnson um and I thought where did that come from we didn't see any of that towards the end of of last season that confidence wasn't there he was was on all the corners as well por wasn't taking any I think he took all but one when he was on the pitch that I think bergal might might have taken one and he was yeah he was clearly the central Cog in everything good that Spurs were were doing and they should have scored more goals in in the first half and POA kogu can come away from that game and he can blame a lot of a lot of players R charon's Miss uh you know Johnson and Son were pretty poor but he can't say anything bad about Madison I don't think because he did more than enough for them to win that game s's poor not on this table um well he's right down in 39th .32 I mean that's generous to be got a decision to make with him this week haven't he well that was I mean in the end I commit I've made my transfers of qu's gone um I the plan was I was going to move Son out to foden but when I saw Ashley Young sent off for Everton which means that Everton Everton will have to line up presumbly with Mason Holgate and the last time we saw Mason hogate you made that ridiculous challenge you know he was playing for sheffeld United wasn't he he made that ridiculous challenge can't remember who it was against now but um yeah I think that yeah I do you think do you think there's that much difference I mean young was and young well there must be I mean d must think that I mean never a good right back yeah he is he is and we we said matoma was goingon to rip it up and he did and he got sent got him red carded but I think son against Holgate is a mismatch surely and the toosi could be out as well so for me I had to 14 fit players D today they've got big you're holding him now interesting so no City attack for you no well it depends you'll see my transfer depends how you define c oh okay yeah yeah um yeah more than that at the end of course but yeah I I think I have to hold on because I I expect Spurs to win that heavily I mean d is comment about 14 fit players that's a cry for help isn't it that's like get me some players please wasn't exped coming through the door and me they they've not replaced anano I guess bran Freight they're desperately trying to hold on to when the window closes if he goes they really are in trouble but if they get a big offer for bran fre you think he would go so they they're gonna have to go out and buy more um because otherwise they're going to be a lot of trouble I mean I do think they will go this season and Squad death could be a real problem to them I think Spurs should Skittle them I mean I think an said postmatch that he wanted to see them more ruthless there was talk of him keeping the team in for 20 minutes postmatch shouting and balling at them I wouldn't be surprised I wouldn't be he's a bit grumpy these days as we very grumpy very grumpy these days no mates in a while no so I think that um I think Spurs will be looking to to show an that they can take their chances and I I think that s was a hold for me which made up my mind really foden should start um I expect him to get at least an hour but he's not going to get the 90 because he's going to be EAS back in and he may not you know I think you know I expect him to come in on the right maybe for Savio Savino rather so yeah I because of that and because I knew that you know foden's gonna get subbed off he's not going to get the full 90 and with son against Holgate I think I had to keep him so that's where I'm going Harland came in 0.28 what did you make of his performance in City at Chelsea I wasn't that impressed with City overall but in the end they probably deserved it um it was very it was like a very Champions performance wasn't it it was there wasn't really a lot of flare professional exactly there wasn't really a lot of flare they had loads of players missing they went there to get the job done and none of their players did badly they were all like what six or seven out of tens and and that was enough um Chelsea did enough to to score and trouble but but didn't and then kovage scored that that great goal I thought kovage was absolutely superb in that match um everyone else was kind of like yeah did all right um yeah I mean Holland Holland was fine and it was a good goal he scored um but yeah it's it's hard to judge on off the back of that one because it was a tough game a tough game really to to go away at Chelsea yeah I mean they'll certainly take the win and like you said I don't we can't take anything from it I think going into this HR game they're still not going to have their full strength side back I don't think Rodriguez appeared on the training pitch this week so he'll probably miss out and he's a big factor and he's we saw look preseason how impressive he's been against the low blocker teams I think he's got six double figure returns last season against the bottom six which is ridiculous you know harand with four and Rodrigo with six so he's a player that they turn to to help break these teams down so they are going to miss him against is if they do turn up with a low block um but fod which they will they're gon they're gonna what do what do you think they're going to do I mean because they were right in the face at Liverpool they were press hard do you think they're going to go with that or they're just going to sit back they are going to the message is going to be don't get thumped right and it's going to be let's just let's just take a two n two-nil in this and go from there surely that's what it what it has to be if they come out gungho and press they're gonna get they're gonna get slaughtered have the Personnel they went man for man against Liverpool I mean if they do that against at home though at home I can see right I can see why I'd be very surprised if they did that again uh this game um ety had second game of the season you've just had a decent performance against Liverpool you go to yead and lose six7 nil it undo everything so yeah I'm expect I'm expecting them to be very defensively set up yeah I'm I'm absolutely dreading it more on that right at the end um just a few more players to pick out inmo um where is he on this table is he on this table or is he just to mention yeah he's down 2 second okay no Tony so on penalties 0.54 in the first game got his goal 7 million and when we talked about jotter being someone that we've got a move to perhaps Ando in that bracket as well when brenford fixtures improve in gameweek six thoughts on that yeah yeah I mean this stuff happen at home in game week three which obviously looks good if you if you went with him early um he's a great FPL asset you can play him against anyone especially when he's got pens I was surprised not to see Tony at all and then yeah for you know for Frank to say he's probably played his last game for us despite they not really being a lot of interest in him there's obviously the Saudi bid that's that's been rumored but it's not like Manchester United Arsenal Spurs This doesn't I don't really know where he goes unless he does go um you know go goes goes to Saudi so yeah I was I was a bit surprised not to be in the squad at all but it looks like that's done now and if it is then obviously neuma is a great pick um I wouldn't be buying him now though just purely because of the fixtures but yeah for game week six good good option yeah no absolutely um let's talk about Inu then we touched him in a little bit so in a lot of teams analytics loved him the algorithm loved him a lot of non- analytics managers loved him as well very popular pick only got the hour well didn't even get the hour did he got 59 minutes so only got the one point playing tonight got the penalty I think he's gone off after an hour so again the presumably I me don't think it's a fitness thing because he played the most minutes didn't he in preseason so I don't know I don't know what they're they whether they're reasing him in somehow or I I don't know maybe there is an issue 58 minutes he's gone off on but he got the penalty uh tonight just before just yeah just before the hour mark you're holding them aren't you with the fixures if we remind people of Chelsea's fixures they're right at the top of the ticker now um walls in gameweek two Palace at home Bournemouth away West Ham away Brighton at home Forest at home I don't have a Chelsea player I'm obviously Jews there you're holding aren't you oh I don't know I don't know I mean I I very nearly made a last minute transfer at Fest which was Gordon and Henderson out for reyya and thenu and you know after um Gordon Blan and and Henderson conceded and Ray obviously had the clean sheet I thought if Inu scores I'm going to be like 15 points down already and I should have done it but he didn't and even though I was still a bit down because of ry's points I am so glad I don't have that that headache to make because yeah I I I I don't know what to do with him I mean looking back at Elite 64 the analytics and the normal and the elite 64 the regular on the general setup he's the fourth across both leagues he's the fourth most picked player so isack first Saka porro en kungu 93% of analytics teams 70% of elite 64 teams neither of us have him but he is very very very popular in in other circles and I think he is a real problem for people um because I think with Felix signing with Jackson obviously starting that game and not being subbed we didn't see enu getting pushed up to the nine for example with Netto coming in on the left Palmer at the 10 I don't know what he does with enu does enu play up front that's what we all thought would happen but it didn't happen in the last game and I think the only way you can hold him is if he is playing up front because it's surely going to be Palmer in the 10 Felix on the right and Netto on the left right that's the that's the strongest three behind the striker I think you think yeah I mean it's um it's basically talk tonight that Palmer's gone off with a hamstring issue he came on after the hour mark and he's finished the game but looks like he was people are saying in the chat he was win to the end of the game so maybe I mean that that would be great for karon because he could be on pen but yeah I it's just a wealth of options I said it in the in the walking talk I did in the at the moment if he's going to go off around the AR Mark every game you know the model doesn't like jota for that reason why would it favor and kunker over jot when jot is playing Center forward for Liverpool and then kungu is playing wide I'm really surprised he's so he's so highly owned in analytics because the minutes have weren't there last season so why yeah like you say why why suddenly do we think he's going to play all the time yeah a lot of threats to his minutes but with those fixtures you've got to hold I don't think it's a question at the moment but another blank and yeah then then the price will be an issue because people will start selling given his ownership there's no question so if he blanks at walls there will be sales um I don't know whether there's merits in selling them because the pictures remain good but I think it's whether you're going to sit there and watch the drop um because I don't like that but others tolerate it and with good fixtures she will um but if if josa bangs again and and then kungu doesn't or E comes in and kungu doesn't then yeah there's going to be a lot of a lot of Shifting around in Midfield I think so he's gonna be a yeah he's gonna be a hard sell for people though like say he blanks against wolves and it's Palace at home yeah you know that's you could be I'll just give him one more week I'll just give him one more week and then we've all been there haven't we we do that we show patience look at look at us with Rich charison last season we both backed him we both had him for like four or five weeks did we and didn't get a single return it's a similar thing we thought he was gonna be down the middle out front and that's what that was the best case scenario for Inu it's not happened yet I think we just need to see more of moresa Chelsea of course we need to see what they're offering um if they start winning games three or four nil then you're going to hold him anyway because even with an hour he's going to get something but I don't know we can't tell anything from that first game of course he wasn't even up front tonight in B Team it was GE up front wasn't it yeah I don't know I mean the other option is obvious he keeps Palmer on the right and then thenu plays in the 10 just behind just behind Jackson but I don't know why you would force Palmer out right when you've bought Felix in for quite big money and we know that Palmer is their best player and you give him that license to you know like what what city with foden and where Palmer ended up playing this rest of the season last last year I think Palmer surely has to start in the 10 in kungu so you got juall as well maresa knows very well I thought juby Hall would been playing every game yeah and and the other and the other thing is that I know it was City and obviously it's a tough game but they played with the three Center M they which obviously creates another another spot missing for for him I think I think he's I think he's a big problem um for him so for for owners and yeah like I said I'm glad I'm not in that I think you have to give him another week like you said you give him wolves and if he if he blanks or get subbed off at 60 I think You' just got to be ruthless with it and just say I'm cashing out on this this is not this is not right because his price is going to drop there's other good six five options you know Bailey is going to come in from game week three um for example you could even go down to a Rogers or there's loads of good options Boma from game week four you just don't want to get stuck with him and not ever move him out yeah we've been in that boat and it can happen um y okay uh let's start looking at the Double the captaincy I say double it's going to be could potentially be trible couldn't it so um let's look at the the table we always look at and I've added a a second table to show Harlem versus the bottom six which is absolutely chilling reading for people like me who don't have it um obviously this is one week of data so we can't read too much in this let's just look at the fixtures I mean jotto and Salah home to brenford if you've got them I mean if you don't have harand salah's the goto right it's is it's not even a question son could be a candidate at home to Everton although Wally showed in that first game probably doesn't instill too much confidence you're basically back in son on the basis of what Evan are going to turn up with foden doesn't really cover Harlem because foden's probably not going to get more than the hour and his first start I wouldn't have thought de bruyne could be a possibility but it's all about Harland right if you got Harland you're captaining him and the question is are you triple captaining him so I'm gonna ask you first where you are with that and whether it's entered your thinking no it hasn't uh and that isn't me saying isn't right to to do it um my issue is is the rodery factor I think is is quite a big one um also I know it's a promoted team and don't get me wrong I massively think that man city could win that game heavily but we have seen in the past surprise shocks happening with promoted teams um who was it a few there was Luton wasn't there last year they Norwich came up and beat Norwich is the one I was thinking of yeah Norwich against city um these games against promoted teams when all that adrenaline all that bars and all the work they put in last year is is still there and the fact city city have kind of lumbered a bit through that Chelsea game okay got the win in the end but fine but still getting players back from Fitness I just don't know if it's a given that that City go absolutely bananas in that game and we there's too many unknowns we don't know what this mystery chip is for example whether we can kind of like dovetail that into our thinking um there could be like snow over Christmas and a game gets cool off got a surprise double so I mean you really are clutching at straws now though aren't you know it's it's it's very very early isn't it to be using using that CH I mean the kind of the the opposite way of that opposite way of thinking that is we know there's probably going to be fewer double game weeks later down the line that's been something that that obviously James PF has talked about and lots of others and also the triple Captain isn't that great let's be honest it's probably 15 20 points Max something something like that the bench boost is it it's no bench boost no well even the bench boost probably is probably worth about that isn't it it is but I only mentioned that to B I see I see hey my Ben did well last year didn't it beat yours it did yeah yeah I I I can I I agree I think that um I did agree inste I started looking at some of this other data uh you know City aren't a full strength um they are still getting players back to Fitness so minute in that game are still going to be things that pep plays with I'm not saying harland's going to come off before the 90 he probably won't but he could because that he's going to try and get minutes in the legs of as many players as he can so even if harand plays a 90 the players around him are going to change right over the course of that game there's going to be changes on the air Mark I think fodm will start but we'll be taken off around that time um doco and sveno if they start will be taken off around that time so it's not going to be a full pel fluid Man City team against it which they they'll still have more than enough to win that game by four or five maybe even more so don't get me wrong but that as you say is a factor in our thinking but look at this look at this table at the bot Harlem versus bottom six over the last two seasons now I'm presuming it's which are going to be bottom six maybe they're not but let's let's say they are going to be in the bottom six most people tip them for that but I actually think they're going to do better maybe not make out as bottom six but they're not going to go down in my eyes but in 2223 harand had 11 starts against the bottom six or the eventual bottom six of That League in that year 849 minutes got 13 goals two assists 92 points 8.4 points per start and then last season eight starts 742 minutes 11 goals two assists 75 points 8.6 points per start so this is saying basically when he comes up against bottom six you can expect eight and a half points yeah so that's the minimum so already if I said to you well you're triple Captain can you know you're guaranteed eight and a half points you're going to take it now there's no guarantees because that's an average and but surely he returns and surely he gets bonus so you are looking around that a minimum aren't you yeah and there there's some good comments in the chat muel porson says hard has fired up can five in a single game has done it before multiple times I'm tempted to Jo Captain obviously neither of us are doubting his ability to to be able to hit five I mean remember when the first um season he came came into the league he got the breaks against West Ham he then only got an assist in that Bournemouth game where everyone was massively backing him in in that but then I think he got was that when he got like back-to-back hattricks against forest and can't remember exactly who the other team was but yeah I mean you know even at the start of the Season Harland hits some some big holes Adam sta points out that kdb is back we know that link up between kdb and Harland is is absolutely crucial um and Manchester United says no Bobba Alvarez to come on no midweek game which obviously is more a fact to win the Champions League so there's there's a lot of Pros to doing it and I I'm not going to sit here and say I think it's a bad idea and you shouldn't do it and all that I just it's very early in the season to be making that that decision and I'd rather wait to get a bit more information about what's what the what the season's going to be shaping up like also it's a bit like you're using a chip early then you got to go a whole season without it knowing everyone else has it and I know that's not the best way to think about it but kind of plays on your mind a bit when you looking at leagues and seeing what chips they've got and you know that you're 10 15 points ahead but then they've got a triple Captain to play and and all of that so if you play it and you get it right and you get 10 15 points from Highland you're gonna be over the moon with that but if it doesn't go well then it's going to be very annoying I want to bring up some more charts from um this is from Rob tfb at Rob TF follow him because he gives some really good um tables based on spread betting odds and it shows that harand he's he's basically his projected goals is 1.34 so he's projected more than one goal 74% chance of getting at least one goal or one goal plus now why that's significant salah's at nor 75 so a big gap between Salah and Harland why that significants Rob's also had a look at um the odds um historically um compared to last season so 1.34 is the highest uh level of projected odds for a goal last season as well it was Harland versus luk where he hit that 1.34 he got 80 minutes in that game and got a goal so compared to all the fixtures last season where we saw projected goals odds 1.34 is the highest right so that's saying this fixture The Bookies think is as good as the best opportunity we saw last season and in the best opportunity last season in the according to their rules it was Harem versus Luton he got 80 minutes in got a goal all the other high projected odds are Harland apart from Salah in gameweek 31 against Sheffield United where it was 1.08 and he only got he got less than an hour and got zero points I probably captained him there um so what this is saying and what Rob's revealed with here is when you look at spread betting odds this opportunity against itwi is level with the best opportunity we saw last season other than double game weeks of course I mean that's the factor that we haven't bought in double game weeks but we know we're going to get fewer we don't know what they're going to be we don't know if rotation is going to be a thing at the time you know there's there's there's stuff we we don't know that we can't Bank on those double game weeks being an opportune moment to back Harland this does look like a great opportunity I know it is early and had it be week 10 or 11 I don't think there'll be too much debate so maybe it's just it shouldn't be a factor though you know where it sits in the season shouldn't be a factor so do you change your mind when you look at this well it can be a factor in the sense of what we've talked about in terms of them not being at Full Tilt and not having Roder I mean this is this is great research by the way from Rob tfpl absolutely amazing stuff I love that the one seller on here out of all of the Sea of Harland is that sheffeld United gate where everyone ripped their teams apart including me to bring him in and he went off at 59 59 minutes um yeah I I do I do like it I I I there will be a double game week at some some point in the season there always is and two games is better than one so even if you have a a player playing for not a man city would you would I still back like a midfielder from I don't know would I still back salanki in a double game week over Harland in one game versus ipswitch yeah I think I would because you you would favor the double game week so it's just about giving yourself that opportunity to um to see realistically though harand is going to score against IP witch yeah and even if you get a bigger double a double Captain down the line trible Captain down the line there's probably not going to be that much in it between them so if you want to do it do it I'm saving it there's a difference of opinion in the chat a really people are split on this um put a poll let's see how many people are actually considering doing how many how many you reckon there'll be so Holland's 50% say if you've got har if you had Harlem would you triple Captain him you know saying he's % fit now against the worst defense in the league bit early to say that about his defense but yeah I mean it could well be I'd got go to you can yeah I probably have to do it in in in YouTube chat yeah um I I if I had him I'm glad I haven't got him and I haven't got this dilemma um but that's the only thing that's the only thing I'm glad about of the day challenged to it oh yeah I mean you know there's no question that that is pure content we couldn't both go into that with harand because it would be a pretty dull experience if that was the case the excitement and nervousness I will have watching that se if the city game comes up first I know it's a big score because if they win two- nil I wouldn't expect them to be the first match on um so we know straight away obviously the the first sign that harland's going to do well is probably there's going to be a lot of people waiting in the lobby to see your face they might be there to see my face and and it'll go my way they might be there to enjoy and share that experience with me but probably not so yeah I mean it's it's it's a key thing isn't it because if you don't play it and you miss this opportunity you are going to kick yourself and it does look I mean these odds are definitely stacked in har favor tempted I'm tempted to do it you're talking me into it I'm really tempted that's gonna be a fun stream if I if I do it imagine that game flashes up first on Match of the day and it's like okay it switch like Nick to one nil here or if they got absolutely B yeah yeah yeah it's um I mean people saying like easiest TC in my life I mean there's a real difference of opinion now I don't know if you managed to get the poll up but I think poll poll's up 200 votes uh 60% of people are saying no 133% saying they don't own him 30% are saying yes you should put it up as as if you did have Harlem would UTC right so where so ownership isn't in there I mean it's yeah that's why I go they don't own an option okay fine okay so we can see yeah um what is this screen just remember oh yes so this is interesting just going forward um this is Lego Mane's table we haven't got our Matrix up and running yet but this is a really good way of doing the Matrix I may well rip this idea off leg man and it goes back to the discussion we had about whether you're moving off harand to Salah because this is really Captain coverage and yes obviously harand gets you in game week two you can play him at West Ham in three brenford at home in four then he has Arsenal Newcastle arguably you could look elsewhere and Salah and Watkins come into the equation there maybe Palmer um if if he works his way into our teams but I guess the question is you know what's your plans with harand you just holding them in all the way through because obviously in game week seven it's full and wall so Anton Bournemouth and you're definitely want you want him for that there are options elsewhere but Salah has a tougher run then he has Chelsea and Arsenal in that SP so one think what I'm asking you is I've got Salah you've got Harland are we sticking like that or are we going to are we going to shuffle around I don't want to lock into it but I I can't see myself dropping dropping harand um I mean Arsenal at home's obviously tough but I'd still expect there to be goals in that as a home game Newcastle away City probably be take a one nil in that but um you know again this you still back him to get get something and then it's a and then it's those four games of ful and wolf Southampton and Bournemouth so even if you're losing him in in five coming straight into a home game against Fulham in game week seven knowing that Southampton at home is then in game week nine yeah that is the worry I think the the biggest factor is foden if I if my stance changes on foden and I think he can you know get close-ish to where harland's going to end up then that might be a long-term move that I make at the moment I don't think that will happen and I think harand is going to be 35 goals again this season that's my that's my current thoughts if that doesn't play out then my my feelings might change um I think you're right I think that he will end up in the 30s but then you look at Salah and think well he's going to get how many assists is he G to get and he gets the extra point for the goal and he gets the extra point for clean sheet so Salah hasn't got to match him for goals he's got to get close to matching him for returns but if he does he could keep Pace um but you know that's a big if cuz Holland's a machine and Sal perhaps I hesitate to say it perhaps we're seeing regression from Salah we would expect to see regression from Sal at some point um but foden I think you're right foden's the factor here just like jot is for Liverpool I think if foden I think foden can grow again this season and let's not forget he outscored harand this last season I don't think that's going to happen this season I think harland's going to be clear of him by some distance but foden can still be a key asset I don't know how many Harland are going to have foden um I don't think don't I don't think any I don't think any are it's it's a lot of money to be putting into that that attack especially when saca's there at 10 and we want to be investing I mean that is if you look at this I mean if you look at sacka there's wolves he's done one in that game Villa Brighton then it's Tottenham Man City away but then again it's Leicester and Southampton two promoted teams in a row in game week six so even if you lose sacka in four or five you're going to want him straight back in for for those two Watkins is the really interesting one because from gameweek three to six that is an unbelievable run for for him in Lester Everton wolves nips switch and then it's Man United at home I'd probably even keep that on the on the on the green and then fan Bournemouth so yeah I want Watkins for that spell I'm not goingon to be able to get in for game three now because my move was going to be son to foden isach to Watkins I'm gonna have to miss him in the Leicester game and get him but I still think he's worth only Everton walls it witch I'm I'm Rogers I think yeah well I see tonight though they're sniffing around Sterling that's the a lot of people saying is that going to be a blow to Rogers I don't think so he's not going to play him in the 10 I don't think so I I don't see that as NE I see that as a threat to Bailey probably because I don't think bayy can play every game we know he's had Fitness issues so they're going to need more more width Sterling could play wide left which means that Rogers doesn't sit in that role but yeah I mean we need Villa attack in that spell for sure either Bailey Rogers very he was very very effective in in the 10 against West Ham Rogers so yeah I I I don't know if they would shift him out to to the left um because of how he he B he just bossed it he got the ball in mid and he and he drove forward and did everything everything right other than score so yeah I don't really see that too much as a threat either we've got over 2,000 people watching which is whoa really good so thank you so much for your support um how's the poll looking has why we got what can I plug while we've got everyone here we've got 56% saying no to the triple captains in the parland uh 28% saying yes and then 15% saying they don't own and the 15% is about in line with um you know ownership I think in terms of those those you know I talk about the analytics 64 and and Elite 64 I think it was around 70% in total owned him or something there was very little difference that's right yeah yeah yeah 7 75 so it's a little bit low in the poll but that's probably because of the wording of of my question um but I mean say 30% do triple Captain him 30% of Harland owners that's 50% or so there's um you know he's 4.5 million owners essentially because there 9 million people and he's 50% owned 10% of that be 450k so they're 900 so then you're looking at 1.3 million I mean that's not going to happen I mean how many triple caps is he going to have he could have six seven 100,000 triple captains I I think a lot of the you know perhaps I hate to say it um casual players will Captain him because they'll look at it as an early chance to get big points on the board and it Swit at home is a great fixture of course and and they will may be on to something we've seen plenty of evidence tonight to show that that could be the case um so I think his his levels of Captain are going to be are going to be pretty high um yeah I'm absolutely dreading it uh let's still predictions um just just just quickly before you do I will do a plug we we a message from Matt wling saying I need discount go for manscape just use blackbox obviously on the thing black box.com manc blackbox right no no no that's everything about that was wrong this is why you don't do it's manscape.com we've got an amazing site built for us by uh lee uh Le and Liv which is yeah I just love being involved in all of that um if you want to join in the predictions obviously you got sleeper but to get involved in this league just head over to patreon.com blackbox f blackbox sign up to that and then you'll get entered into this league um as well and there is going to be a trophy for the the top scorers in this and obviously a trophy for the winner of The blackbox League um you've got to be a patreon member for at least six months to win the trophy in either of these but you got plenty of time to get involved if you want to do that head over there now look at this impressive scores here in the leaderboard um correct outcomes mostly all over this is a top 20 60 70% with 180% there from Tom gold 19 195 if D is top with a total score of 15 points predicted 10 scores 40% correct score so you got four of the 10 correct scores 70% correct outcome four scores crazy it I got two correct you got one correct beat me on outcome so I'm slightly ahead at the moment some big names in here including Niger the crab um so we'll look at this every week and see how as and I are getting on versus all the members of this league so thanks again live and Lee for putting this together here's this week's predictions then and we got a go yeah of course right let's go for it Brighton man united you've gone two1 I've gone 22 talk me about yeah talk to me about the Brighton win then you're very confident yeah I think it's a bad time to be playing Brighton we've got a real spring and last step at the moment you know good attacking players I think ten hog said at the end of the game that um they weren't ready which I thought was was quite telling and there's obviously still some signings they're looking to make and I did think it was a decent performance but it wasn't exactly dazzling but I think Brighton did Dazzle in that game after they got through the initial shock of Everton's Everton's start which was quite fast they dealt with that well and then and they played well I just think we've got so many players that can cause problems and it's a difficult time to play us at the start of the season um you know it might be that we get a bit later on and teams work us out a little bit more but new manager new tactics exciting Wingers um great feeling around the club and we've got a good record against Manu as well so I think we win this one yeah I've gone a game of goals too all um we'll see how that goes we won't be watching it live of course are you nervous about watching that I mean I I've got to watch Forest at sampton on match today having not known the score and you've got to watch Brighton so I don't I'm going to be pretty swey and pretty excited watching Forest not are you be the same right okay yeah well last last time it was Brighton V wolves if you remember when we did a mat Challenge and Brighton won that game convincingly a stupidman got a massive hole and you had him benched so if it's anything like that again I'll be I'll be very happy 14 points didn't he oh and he got the the luckiest assist because he gave the ball to mat from about on the halfway line matuma just DED through the entire woles defense that was a great that was a great goal that wasn't great wasn't great at All panace West Ham I think there's a difficult one because pan seem to be just they're busily selling all their players aren't they so I don't know but I mean Mark go I don't know if he's going to play in this because you know all around him players are leaving um I don't know they are they getting rid of their players just so they can keep a I mean there gonna be nothing left at this rate got nothing left B uh yeah I don't know if they sell gayi as well and they lose their going to that's that's my thinking yeah think he's gonna go he still think he's gonna go to Newcastle yeah um well it's going to be Richards then on his own is it just you know like Jon Snow pulling his sword out against the onslaught then again the onslaught of West Ham attacks yeah Antonio full kran soorry that's a bit disrespectful to them they've also got Peta and Bowen who and kudus who who are great um yeah Tri tricky one to predict I've just gone for the home the home win West Ham I thought were were decent in the second half against Villa they need to get some of those new signings on the pitch they look like they need some fresh blood I thought in that first half and Somerville came on they need to get full crew going I think Antonio's just done um he's been an amazing servant for them but they need to get someone else into that position um but yeah I mean they've got a decent side I think they probably score but mateta is back isn't he and a and people so they should have enough attacking wise but it should be close next two we're both agreeing on the outcome and the score fullham two left to nil is what we're going for I don't think there's too much time there what a dream score line that would be if Smith R comes in as well that'll be very good both well are we both playing Robinson more that in a minute uh I've gone 3-0 City I thought I was being conservative but you've gone the same so what what's your thinking then that they get like two n up three n up and then just take the foot off yeah I think so I think they it's I don't want to say that stupid cliche line of if they score early then the floodgates might open or something like that you know because it's pointless but I think it sort of is that it sort of is that in a way because I my guess is that switch defend set up really really a really good shape they're an organized team great manager he he's not going to want them to get beat heavily and I think if they can make it to halftime maybe one nil down they can see out a two or three a three nil if city is scoring the first 10 minutes and go into the half free up then it could be a seven or eight we're agreeing on the next one as well we' both gone 21 Newcastle Bournemouth one Newcastle 2 this is on TV and this is near as we get to a a a garden center game was it 5:30 Saturday is that right just get this right no it's Sunday two o'clock Sunday yeah because W Chelsea isn't on the TV so it's Prime Garden Center time two o'clock Sunday afternoon if you must go that's when you go because I don't think Bournemouth newcast G be much of a spectacle we're both going 2-1 for newcast no and it's I mean it's also everyone's got esack anyway no one's going to be captaining him so no one really cares what happens there I've got Gordon but away from home he's ni I've got Gordon but he's away from home I'm not expecting too much from that and there's going to be a few people playing like Hall isn't there and and some of those but yeah I think it's better things to be doing on a Sunday at two w Chelsea both gone a draw we're agreeing on a lot here you've gone two all though I've gone one all um again tricky to call don't know I still don't know where I am with Chelsea wolves are settling down after a lot of lot of ins and outs uh I think O'Neal add them I don't think they lose this um and yeah I agree I think they'll get a point at least Liverpool brenford you gone 3-1 so you see brenford getting the goal I've gone two nil I I I'm quite invested in this Liverpool defense I think they will I think they will get another shut out and then that one well I just think canate misses an like loses an aerial jaw and and in sneaks in with yeah sneaks in nearst and then he's off for for concerts yeah that's my in that one fair enough uh then foreston or S Forest one all both gone for that I think that's about I think that's how I see it going I think it's a tough game for Forest they played well s didn't they I know I obviously Newcastle had 10 men but they had they had chances before that red card I thought they would they look slick um they really shouldn't have lost it I think they'll be gutted to lose lose that game obviously when a team goes down to 10 men you expect to get something from it but the chances they created compared to what like the one chance Newcastle created in the whole whole game M they'll be really disappointed with with that um but yeah they I thought all all three promoted teams were a lot better than I thought they were going to be yeah but this happens doesn't it I I think I said on the forest pod today that the the promoted teams can go start one of two ways Forest started badly and it we were overwhelmed but often the teams start well and then it'll be game six seven when fatigue the lack of squad depth and one or two beatings start to take the morale out and then that's when we start seeing the if we are going to get a Whipping Boy that's when we'll start seeing it emerge so I agree with you they've started well but we've seen the likes of knowledge do that and then suddenly out of nowhere they become whipping boys so judgment is uh is paused for the moment but I agree I think santom will cause US problems and of course we won't have Eddie inet in this game but hopefully he's through the door very soon oh we haven't even talked about and Moreno both both sides yeah I mean I love Moreno as well but Eddie has been one of my favorite players for a while and whenever he gets into that Arsenal team I always try and get him in my fantasy lineup so for him to be landing at Forest I'll be absolutely delighted at that I mean lot of forest fans are saying what a waste of money he's average not having that I think he's a good signing yeah I like him I like him as well um there's issues obviously with tyho isn't there still with this injury and can he get back to his best and and everything and I mean chriswood has been nothing short of incredible since heed for Forest but I think eneter is is a very very intelligent and good player so we'll give you something a bit different as well because they're they're similar mold aren't they those two and different and he's going down in price tomorrow so it'll be 5'9 by the time he gets if he does Forest 5'9 definitely could be an option for us uh then we go to Spurs Everton you've gone two nil I've gone fournil I've gone well if di you saying he's got 14 fit players and Brighton put three past him at gooderson surely Spurs can go one better so going in with son and salanki I've got to hope that they somewhat cover the damage that harland's going to do to my team so I've gone fournil I don't I don't see ever I mean Everton are struggling AR they yeah it's just going to be another one though where he's going to put every man behind the ball and say come on Spurs break us down yeah yeah and can they if Madison's on on song again then they've got a very good chance um I think Kulu comes into this game as well he's obviously got that ability to to cut through cut through defenses um yeah they'll they'll be hopeful to bounce back because that is a really really poor result against Leicester they should have been out of sight in that game so yeah I think 4-nil would be great but I think I think Posta cogle would be happy with a a routine too you are right they are going to put 11 Men Behind the ball but one of those men is going to be Mason Holgate and I was reminded that it was matoba who he who he CED down cut in half well this is the you know here's the common the common theme it's always always alwaysa uh then we end on Villa Arsenal I've gone 2- nil I just think again the Arsenal machine rolls on clean sheet you've gone 2-1 Villa get a goal then um that's going to be a decent Monday night game though isn't it yeah I'm looking forward to that I thought Villa you know I think bayy was unlucky not to get something Rogers unlucky not to get something Watkins didn't look quite fit but you know we'll we'll be building that up Duran came on and and scored a good goal as well and like Arsenal put in a very very confident performance but also had moments of looking a little bit sloppy and I think again it's a good time to play them because it's early in the season and I think in six months time then they're just going to be they're going to be such a hard team to beat for the title I think this season because I think they're just going to click and just go through the motions and and just you know teams are going to find it so hard to score against them and they've got so much attacking threat up top um that the teams are going to struggle but right now I think teams will look to get at them and I think that was what I was annoyed with the Wolves because I think they should have got out them a bit more and they should have converted the Chan they had and I think Villa will get at least one it's not the Monday night game it's Saturday evening we won't be able to watch it live because we'll be one uh one change I've requested to this is uh for the order to go back to the games so lives lives Chang it now so it's going to have the times and the days on them order she's already made that change that'll be in effect from next week but you'll been hitching soon I'm so I know I'm looking forward to that um something rhyming with hitching in Hitching um soing and itching we've got that got that in Chicken George on a neon sign and mean you've booked dinner right you got the restaurant all lined up restaurant all lined up C bass for Billy brilliant he's coming with us so I've got to book the hotel I'm really looking I'm I am looking forward to it but I'm I'm dreading it at the same time have you not built the hotel yet you're coming in like two days it'll be fine a very bustling town oh don't give me that if I'm struggling to get a hotel room and hitching please don't try that one right let's look at our teams because I want to get to some of those super chats particularly slippers um let's get your team up oh your team's not there where's your Mark where's my I sent you did you drop the team in oh I sent it on what's up well that's no good you need to put it in the folder let's look at my team why you do that then ah Deary me one job as one job right I'm gonna go through my team and it's got the transfer in it so for the podcast Rya porro who's fit we saw him train today we saw the tattoo on the back of his calf we expect him to be lining up there so Rya and Pao Trent and then the sign in Rico Lewis coming in probably just for the game week but we more than him in a bit Smith Rose saaka Salah Captain son xia Pedro isak salanki then Robinson first sub Rogers and coner so here's the question for you hang on don't ask me a question yet I'm still trying to do the okay well I need to ask you a question Jal Pedro or Robinson do I start xia Pedro against man united or do I go Robinson for the clean sheet against leester oh it's not very close on the alos rate my team and review think play this play J ped Ro but I don't see Leicester scoring and I see Robinson getting forward and I also see xia Pedro getting I see routa playing right he's gonna get some minutes so surely he's been he's that's very early he's only only signed the other day I think he needs at least a week of training um I would play Pedro he's got the penalties isn't he and he's the attacking player but it's close I think Robin gets a clean sheet and could even get an attack it is very close between them but I would be more worried about benching Pedro I think fair enough I'm not sure about this Lewis move you're not you've moved one player who's a massive risk to another player who's a massive risk pure upside I mean I've got I've got Robinson I've got Robinson and conso if I didn't have Robinson and conso I couldn't do it so I don't need Lewis be on this and I've just wanted some skin in that game I don't want to go into that City game with nothing so I mean like if if City keep a clean sheet then then harland's got to get a goal to even beat Lewis right so that's the way I look at it is that I could get suming out that City game through Lewis I think they will keep a clean sheet I think he will get an hour at least he looked very good at Chelsea and he was getting forward um so if they win by a big margin he may even get a return so you know what pep like with Defenders though he'll play him though won He he'll play him is in and then he's out he in then he's out Stones is there Walker's there he's not going to start I mean if it's a low block he's playing Lewis because you're not playing Walker against a low block you're playing Lewis because Lewis gives you that low Center gravity a bit of craft a bit of gu so in the games where they've got to break down a team I think Lewis will be will have a good chance of starting I think he starts Walker will get on the pitch I was surprised he didn't come on at Chelsea though Walker I mean because foden did but Walker didn't get any minutes at all which was a bit odd given that presumably they want to get him minutes he will come on Lewis Will Lewis won't get the full game but I think he'll get enough to get me if they do keep a clean sheet to get me that clean sheet so it's a pure upside pick again no one who you know no analytics manager is going to go in because of the X-Men's so and because it's a bad idea but but I think mostly yeah but I think it's um I because I got the luxury of conso I can do it right because got a Defender I can bring in from game three yeah did you do it though because you you're desperate to have a man C player against I yes partly yes yeah fair enough fair but also I think that there there is an upside to Chase and where that where I see the opportunity I will do it uh and also we don't know I mean pep was you know talking very very strongly about Lewis's performance if he starts against Hit I expect him to do well again so maybe he is going to turn up at West Ham the week after but I don't need him for that because I'll have Robinson and coner as well as Trent and porro so I don't I think that's the advantage you've got is if you if you have a four million like if you had Barco as well then you obviously wouldn't be able to make that that move um but you've got coner and and Robinson even if porro tomorrow I know we've we we think he's been in training but you know even if tomorrow padro was out that would actually do your favor because then you can bring Robinson in and people like me who haven't got a replacement for POR in big trouble so there must be a part of you that's kind of hoping that he isn't fit to play in that game the way I look at it is that I could go Lewis because I had that security of Robinson and coner so I was probably in a unique position where I could exploit it whereas most managers wouldn't look at Lewis because they need to have a a you know a a Freeman defense for game week three um I'll have that no matter what even if I get an injury so I think it was a luxury I could afford to make and it may come off we'll see um you never know um Lewis is a player I lot I'd love him to be a regular this season but obviously Walker shirt to lose isn't it even though he hasn't got moment Pet's in the chat if P team says leis is good enough to become First Choice he is I agree his talent is undeniable and if he does then you want to a Master stroke there with with 4.5 I just think it's funny that you've gone from quona who's this milon Defender over to another massive risk um but yeah exactly and that's that was the thinking behind quo I knew there was risk there but I knew that from game week three I had coverage for it anyway what I didn't see coming is him losing his place before gameweek three for coner so I've repeating I'm repea in the act because I've set my team up to allow myself that risk because I looked at him think well if con's a regular four five Liverpool I want him so let's get him in and then see how that goes and it's gone very badly so now I'm doing the same with Lewis I'm going well if he's going to be a regular at four five for City I want him if it doesn't come off I've got the security of of Robinson and conto anyway so it's fine so I've set my team up to enable me to take risks I've got to take them haven't I if that's been the purpose of that setup so you can get kiwi next and hope that he breaks into yes I might well get caly actually um if I can because we've talked about him being the best Arsenal asset and maybe when the Arsenal pictures improve we'll want that second Arsenal Defender so that that day might come but at the moment we'll see how leis goes i' got got bad news that that that joke doesn't actually work because kiwi was five million but uh nice Trio let's just gloss over that yeah thank yeah uh now can we can we can we have a look at your team is it in there I think so no it's not so well the thing is the image has been deleted from black B you deleted it somehow that's why there's no image in there at all because it should be last week's one so I put a new one in with the old name so you just need to is it that one there that is the one right there you go and it fits perfectly so that went really quick kind of surprised me uh head in goal with Trent porro and Robinson sacka J Gordon Smith row Harland captain isack and sanki and Bentley and Rogers on the bench that's fine but then Barco and Johnson so if padro is if Pedro's out oh out I am in a bit of trouble um in fact if parro's out I probably I'll probably sell him because it's oh wow really well it's Arsenal and Newcastle Newcastle and Arsenal isn't it after that so if he's out it's either a four million Defender spot to get in like Harwood Bellis or it's take a punt on someone at five5 is the TR is I don't know who I'd get I was looking at a Ki for example but then I think I've run a similar risk with that that you've got with Lewis but I'm paying a million more so I could go for moono but then I've already got Henderson in goal so yeah I don't really know what I'd what I'd do Pedro's fine though don't worry he's fine he's going to turn up isn't he and I expect him to get something out of that game so I don't think you got that what are you going to do surely you've got to address the Barco Johnson dilemma haven't you I say dilemma it's a the well Barco debacle Barco de I don't think I have really because I've got Trent porro and Robinson who I'm happy to play just gonna leave them stinking out the bench are you well I don't need them do I unless there's an injury like those three are are all absolute First Choice players unless there's a problem with Robinson or there's an injury I just play them every week and don't really worry about I mean Johnson for all we know wasn't quite fit and wasn't quite ready and comes back in and if he if he's starting games zip Swit have actually got a decent Run for the next after this city City match so he he'll be fine then it's just Barco who really cares about your third minute third place um bench so yeah but in terms of the team itself I'm quite happy with it um obviously last week I was thinking ryer and and and kungu this week I'm happy happier with Henderson and Gordon than if I had those two because I think Ry concedes to Villa and then kungu God knows what we're going to get from him so I'm happy with those two I've got the two fuling players in um I've got jotter there Trent yeah I think it's I think it's a decent team this week so we'll see we'll see how it goes yes we'll see on maybe the triple Captain yeah yeah well I don't think I'll do it I don't think I do just just very good people are asking about barco's price I believe Neil did some research into this bless him he looked back on the last 50 loone mov out and none of them went down in price that's correct right that's what he's saying yeah and the biggest one was Canelo who had 1.5 million sales after his low move to Bayern because he was like 20% owned or 25% owned and he did not drop in price so as soon as Barco gets that flag we can be relatively confident that he won't drop and I think if B doesn't drop in price then you know I think I can I can be forgiven for my my sins uh if he drops to 39 then the lynch mobs are going to come out with oh yeah definitely I mean I'm I'm only coming to hitching so I can write down your address to give it out on the internet yeah oh my God can you imagine I thought you were gonna say the restaurant we might have a let's hope we don't get recognized because we don't want to know the scores what are we going to do to avoid the scores what you're going to the cinema right I've said to my family we've got to go somewhere remote where I cannot be exposed to anyone who might mention scores or well I can't overhear scores it's very difficult isn't it well you're going to have to how how long is it going to take you to get to mine about an hour and a half yeah yeah so we're Le about half five so so the T the table's book for quarter quarter to seven right and it's a bit of a walk from the station so I this is the content they want by the way they want this is why it say 2,000 people watching maybe you should leave a bit earlier than that right we've got we've got shuffle board booked after after the the meal yeah and and um and then some drinks somewhere we're gonna need drinks after match of the day I think and I might need a lot of and I've got a I've got a keg I've got a k lined up for us for the for the day challenge oh dear right should we hit oh we got to talk about um have we got to talk about pick him at the end I haven't got that in there so we can't so um there you go wrong link no title um no we haven't got to talk about picking because we did the for them at at the start let's go back to the start and hit some of these uh super chats we've got 10 in there thank you very much for your Super Chat uh let's start with with kth and evening Boys best replacement who in your opinion assume is a non-star this weekend he's not going to be a non-starter is he I think he still starts he went off after the hour I think he still gets the Wolves game if you're shopping for 65 low I guess you got to start looking at biley haven't you but perhaps not yet I would hold him and then look at bayy game week three what do you about you as thanks for the super chat kenth um yeah I think Bailey at 65 is is probably the one or you give him that Palace game and then you move from matoma after Arsenal matoma you're really going to push another Brighton player two two home games from from game week four in a row and if we still look as good as we have done preseason and now then I think we're going to be wanting to tap into Brighton in some capacity and I think like I said I think he's worth the extra million over M might well change it in the next few weeks I think it's close it's closer between Bailey and matoma though right like both with good fixtures for for a couple yeah I guess so I I guess we want to see what happens with the Sterling talk if that comes in but I mean Bailey will still get those fixtures um I I mean you're holding Ki for walls though I don't think there's any evidence tonight to suggest that he won't start that game but he may only get the hour again which is a bit of a weird thing I maybe know I would I would be tempted to get rid of him and just get rid of it yeah it's just I just at this point don't really know who you would get because well here's another Inu question from Joel right who would you start between hunu and Gabrielle had Gabrielle a week and reckon I'd be content if hunu did well on my bench for the fixures fs I was talking to sbat in the Q&A earlier and she's benching in kungu for Gabrielle no CBA sorry cba's playing over than kungu so she's playing for really to not play I Joel's asking yeah I was like that's when you know you've lost faith in your in your player I just think Villa score and so if Villa score then even inku Off the Bench is a better option than than your than your Defender who's conceded so I would still play in kungu I think think I don't think Villa score no M I think Gabrielle I mean set pieces could be an issue for Villa I think I would probably go with Gabrielle it's an away game for Chelsea if it was a home game I'd probably back inku but if the Palmer injur is a thing and then kungu could be on pens then that would change my mind but saying to bench you're saying to bench and kungu for a Defender think he's a I think Gabriel I think arsal going to keep have a clean sheet it's an away game though I mean and kung's got home fixtures to come yeah I mean it's very very tight isn't it I mean is an hour and kungu gonna I mean he could go off in 59 again couldn't he I mean that's the that's why I think you get rid of him that's what I mean I think I'm leaning I think I'm leaning to Ws get rid of him um as if I if I was asked um thanks Joel for your for your Super Chat thank you for your support on that uh mayor SK mayor rather G us 50 SK I don't TK I don't know what that currency is that a Scandinavian currency I don't know you know do you know no I don't know no I'm sorry but he's he's look at this he's saying got Timber last season based on has picks this year I got bar that's the best Super Chat we've had so far thank you very much not easy doing these is it Timber got a season ending injury in like the first game week there's not much I can do about that one here I'm loving the Super Chat St uh is always as who's the next four million to play in Spain game rout three uh well probably moscara you might be off on a low move uh I'll go to slippers here and he's saying do you think Barco will start game week two I think he will will he get straight that cor straight the such a [ __ ] no love for Rico Lewis no definitely love as you would have seen Jordan thank you for the super chat um only only a true masochist would be moving coner to Rico Lewis I think only a true Maverick only someone who plays their own game would do that there's very few of us left um Nigel the crab Felix better in the 10 or as a f Nigel stop throwing us 10 pounds by the way masas I can't pronounce this I could never do it in football manager can you pronounce that word I know it's track otista very good yes I just need to remind him uh he's not super out wide but based on what we've seen tonight Chelsea fans were not oppressed again I really I mean I don't I haven't seen the feedback Felix play no but he's talking about he's talking about Inu isn't he oh I see yeah I presume um so yeah I mean Felix is going to cause problems that's another Factor behind the whole inun insecurity isn't it um he did well in the first Bell Chelsea no he didn't I thought he did I thought he played well yeah I thought I thought he had some good games for them um his output great was never a fancy assist but I was always impressed when I saw him yeah no I thought he was I thought he showed signs that he could be a good asset for them but never really delivered different different Felix to to me I thought he was he was bang average I think he's been bang average in well theyve just spent 45 million on him so Chelsea must have seen something I just can't believe they' bought him for 45 million I it just it Baff they wanted rid of Gallagher so much like their second best player last season who literally bleeds for the club to bring in a player who was he's a good in my opinion yeah he hasn't done it in year he was he was like Golden Boy wasn't he 100 million to Atletico yeah yeah and he hasn't delivered since then in any spells Chelsea Barcelona Athletico I don't know I I just I don't see it but that's what what meron said about de bruyne so maybe I think is the Chelsea faer weren't impressed with what they saw tonight um so mesa's system taking time to settle down and maybe Felix is the the key to that maybe he's going to maybe he's going to unlock a new Chelsea um I don't know he's not a fancy asset but he could be a player that could get the rest of the players around him going um but yeah it's just I think this we're not going near them I don't think at this rate I just I don't know what to do with like like with with like even if Felix plays like a false nine and then they have just Netto on the left just means that the only place fru is in the 10 which is Palmer's arguably best position so if Felix plays in the 10 then he's taken the place of Palmer I don't know I just think Palmer plays in the 10 which I think only leaves enu up front and I he has two1 he he know well he's currently playing two1 or that that was a system I expected him to play um but he didn't do that against City because he had the three defensive midfielders I expected there to be two1 on the pitch at wolves but we'll see we got to see I haven't looked tonight what formation they played well presumably that would be inku Palmer yeah and K and Palmer but Felix will come into one of those and juby halls there as well so just competition it's too much too much I don't like it uh youf thank you very much for the $5 Super Chat no seller no Harland no City my draft 2.5 in the bank I won't ask I don't know how you ended up with that should I sell Bruno for foden poro toio Salah to saaka or free hit to bring City in don't free hit yeah don't free hit that's an easy one I would do Bruno to foden I probably think about that yeah if I had the money to do that I'd do that as well I mean the only reason I haven't gone son to foden is because son's got Everton at home whereas Bruno at Brighton he won't be in the force nine we're yet to see if that's a good thing or bad for him but I I I mean you're gonna I mean if you haven't got any City you're going to want to get to foden eventually I think so go in early and see if you can profit from this hitw game I think that's the mo I wouldn't sell porro I think he could be maybe not a season keeper but good as and yeah you don't want to be selling sacka because he's a sah because he's going to be your captain isn't he so you can't get say he says no Salah it says no Salah at the start so I think it should be oh I see I think it's sacka Sal yeah I think so no I wouldn't do that either sacka sack's a season hold for me I think unless something dramatic happens um I prefer porro to gardio because of the attacking threat I definitely wouldn't free hit and I think Bruno to foden gives you a good option and unless you know Bruno steps up with a after the final whistle penalty which I'm still not bitched about after all these years he's not a season keeper though is he Bruno I think Bruno is for fixtures and The Season's gonna be strong I don't get it I don't get that pick at all but yeah as as people keep pointing out in the chat oh if I says to do this then I'm going to do the opposite yeah very clever everyone watching aren you 2000 love the show Mark I'm so tempted by giz white to do to have another city attack for this game FS already own VY old Harland and Salah gives white to doku doku is not a long-term option but I remember last season somebody asked me this should I go to doku and then that was the game that doku got the 21 pointer so I'm lowed to say it's a bad idea I don't see Forest scoring more than one goal at sampton I don't think it'd be a game of goals so I think you could safely move off Gibbs white to doku and I think get him another ticket in that game in that raffle could be worthwhile I don't know how many minutes doer will get because greish will be on the bench again he'll be on the pit he'll get on the pitch at some point we think um Savino is fit as well and foden's probably gonna start so where I don't know I I think Docker is going to start the game but how long is he G to get but I think it's worth the gamble yeah unless the unless keeping the transfer is really valuable to you I think there's I think it's a valid move thought what what did you makebs white um I think that getting Eddie and ker is going to really help him because he's he's lacking that runner in front of him like at the moment when he breaks and he gets in the pocket and he's running he's either taking a shot or he's slotting in one of the Wingers whereas if he's got a nine in front of him Brennan was very good at getting inside and that's how gives white got some of his assists and when Ty's fit he can play the ball through for Tyro he can't do that for chriswood so if Eddie gets in Gibbs White's going to come alive again but I don't see him I don't see him returning heavily in these next two I think he could get a return over the next two but no more than that whereas dku could go mad if if if it switch get absolutely blitzed but yeah I mean it depends how valuable using a transfer is to you Dar I mean I I see a lot of people saying well using transfers for vanity moves is crazy and that is a vanity move Gibbs white could get something at sampton we could get a penalty dku is not a penalty Taker and he's only going to get an hour so it is definitely a vanity move but it could pay off um he's a funny player doku isn't he because that 21 was just like the biggest anomaly ever because he he gets the ball and he looks so threatening when he runs he's so fast but that final ball and the shot is just not not there and doesn't seem to be improving from from what I've seen but he's the kind of blow who could just get a 20o this game and you wouldn't be too surprised I don't think I'd do it given that Forest have Southampton and gives on penalty yeah but it's and and also we've got Wolves at home next game and Gib white loves the walls at home game so that's the other thing I think you're right because I wouldn't want to not have Gibbs white for that game if I've owned him going into game week two because Wolves at home he will he will lift and he scored against him last season he want he'll want to score in that game for sure and every week you're gonna be looking at doy wondering if he's going to play the anxiety stubbed off early yeah uh pakota delass um thank you very much for the Super Chat St and kungu or Jacob Murphy I would start and kungu because I don't sure Jacob Murphy's going to get the start because Barnes is making noises of disgruntlement about is Harvey Barnes again Barnes is Back Barn never gonna play for Newcastle while you keep saying saying no it's my fault but you I think you starting kungu over Murphy Murphy's only get a similar number of minutes to in kungu Murphy's at bouth and kungu at Wolves yeah I go and kungu here what you think think oh surely you're not going to go Murphy over and kungu Murphy away at Bournemouth no I think I'd probably playing kungu yeah yeah and then the last one it's not a question it's just a big up thank you very much fbl Banton the best fbl podcast by considerable distance this channel should have 10 SI subscribers and be the second biggest fbl second biggest doing so well at it was going so well to that I don't want slippers hearing that thank you very much to everybody who watched tonight um we're still on 1900 we hit over 2,100 tonight which is excellent um considering we don't have the data behind us yet um perhaps we'll have some more of that next how two hours with no data oh you know it's easy it's easy talking to you about FBO and also we wanted to spend about 25 minutes on Barco so it's all good I think we have the worst part is we've kind of like done it throughout the podcast getting all out the way early on and don't yeah don't think we're not going to do it throughout the whole season either as you're not going to forget it that's for sure I I C the title you did the thumb you couldn't have put quaner on could you put bloody bar on no shouldn't let me have control of these things um no so join us Saturday night we're goingon to be streaming when is matchday 10:30 uh yeah I think so okay and so we're gonna have the ey player set up are we and is Yelena doing it as well or not no she's she's going to be doing her Vlogs so she she needs the content but she's going to in the Vlog she's going to be able to like B we're going to see her like disappear off somewhere where she's obviously gone to the toilet to be like oh my God the Holland just scored his eighth goal of the game and they don't even know then she's going to come back and film us and we're going to be I'm going to be looking at her to see whether or not she's given anything away with and her and Billy gonna be whispering it's gonna be awful absolutely awful yeah it was bad last time remember they were in like Cahoots because they were like sh were looking at schools on their phones and stuff yeah um yeah we're gonna need a H I don't know we're we're going to we're going to suffer I think one of us and it's normally me so I'm dreading the odds are it's going to be me again please let this one go my way just Salah get a son get a brace that's what I need son get can't believe I just sal sal the next day yeah exactly I know it's harsh oh dreading it but join us for that because it's going to be pretty good I think it's going to be you know we've deliberately gone in with different teams um our Allegiance are going to be split both our teams are playing as well so you get to see our emotions as we watch our teams play as well so that's going to be a cracker so join us on this channel we think at 10:30 as hasn't checked it out um but it'll be when when you're watching match a DAT you know we're on have us on your iPad your iPhone or whatever we have we've missed a Super Chat oh have we what is it h it's a nice one to actually end the stream on it's from Alexander Philipp it just say who will be the biggest F troll of the season I mean he's already on the screen is he well well could be in kungu couldn't it yeah it could well be in kungu but I don't think it will be um that's hard to say it could well be early on because you know where much has been expected of him and and Chelsea are settling down I think he will come good eventually he's too good a player not to um it's too difficult to say at the moment really isn't it I mean from what we saw gameweek one it was very predictable saaka Salah delivered harand delivered everything went Accord into the book there was nothing really that shocked me or took me by surprise um in terms of ownership it's not like players like Bowen have got high ownership and will upset a lot of players because maybe he doesn't have the kind of season that is expected of him let's just let's have a look stats at high ownership and see who we got um any thoughts on this at the moment as what' you reckon well I think I think after game week one then kungu is the obvious pick because he's a high highly own player with good fixtures but not guaranteed to starting the team um it could also also be pal as well yeah at 105 just given the amount of price he's had it's the biggest price rise ever and he's going to need to deliver close to 200 points again and that's a big ask right for a player who's come into the side and and obviously had such an amazing season to do that again under a new manager um they're the two that kind of strike me as as as maybe the biggest yeah I agree I mean salanki could be another one right it's 30% ownership is in my team we're expecting big things of him you know you think he'll deliver do you well I I watched that um the the cover you know Gary eville and carer talking about sani's previous seasons and it really is you take out last season the Premier League and he has had some rotters yeah in the in the Premier League and obviously had the great Championship season but his goal scoring record in other seasons has been really really poor um and I think I can't remember which way around it was I think it was carrier saying uh you know he he I think it was Neville say he thought it was a great signing and carrier saying well look at this and actually you know there is a bit of an element of to this so it could go either way but I I'm back in sank I think he's going to do well there all right so we're going for a Chelsea player at the moment and kker or Pala as the biggest trolls possibly this season not they won't score points just they won't score what we need them to given their ownership that's exactly y all right join us on Saturday for what could be a momentous match of the day stream I'm taking my camera as well so I'm going to be doing some vlogging too yeah me I know with the same camera cover board all good all right thank you as um another great stream thank you for all those who joined us and we'll see you on Saturday it's a good night for me good night everyone [Music] [Music]",27305
32,fplblackbox,U7A6-WjhO9s,FPL Quansah Quandary | GW2,2024-08-20T20:36:01Z,[Music] so at least three or four people said to me yeah when are you you're going to bring the the walk up out videos back you know the let's walk FPL the ones where you go around the parks and stuff three or four people said that so as far as I'm concerned this is back by popular demand uh game week one of course I have to start with Fest we were at Fest on Friday night for the first game and it was the biggest and best Fest we've ever done I think brand new venue we had the football the internet yeah crazy isn't it um so yeah very successful Fest look at that up I might do a Christmas event but also look it up next season you haven't been to a fesal make sure you come it is a great event right the matches Friday um we were there watching man united Fulham and I've got to say as a non Bruno owner and he was quite popular he ended up in a lot of teams right in the final few days saw some captains as well and I was very fortunate to escape without him getting a hole to be honest in an early setb he six shots still the most in the game week 1.2 to xgi still the most in the game week Leno kept him out really two big chances in the the force nine but I don't think that's going to continue CU of course zerki came off the bench got the winner and I think he'll start in game week two at Brighton elsewhere gacho didn't start the game came on for Dio um I think Doo got an hour orad uh I think gacho gets that shirt longterm low with rashford on the other flank and gacho got the assist missed a massive big chance as well at the end which got another big Roar at Fest so garach owners as well as Brunos are really unfortunate and then elsewhere of United is mainly the defense that interested me Maz rui I had to look that up of course can't pronounce that out in the book Maz rui came in 4 Five played right back and darlo moved to the left which I didn't expect I he obviously crept in very late in fbl pricing and didn't expect him to start the game but he was impressive he topped for Baseline bonus for Man United got two bonus points eventually and United kept them to n44 XG which is the lowest in the game we AV and sampton who who played 10 men the United defense obviously really early might be worth it look and Maz rui could be a very handy four five option and we'll see why that could be handy in a minute uh as for Fulham Smith row kept very quiet only got the hour 63 minutes I think he was subbed on no shots I don't think a chance created either but I'm not worried about it as a Smith row owner you shouldn't be because they've got amazing fixtures to come from now on right after game week 12 and him Robinson and munz although quiet Old Trafford Robinson was high those three though are going to be very handy owns from this point [Music] on it's s Liverpool then um I was worried at halim as was slot I think because it Swit started so positive so aggressive really pressing High in their face and Liverpool just stalled out the blocks they just didn't get anything flowing at all slot changed it at half time made one change and it was a key change for me quo went off eventually obviously missed out on the clean sheet he bought canate on and he he singled jel quo out in his postmatch and said that Liverpool weren't winning enough Jews but singled out Quanza and he did struggle with the lap he had one period on the on the flank where dap out paced him out muscled him and I see it I think it was harsh on coner and now it's like do we do we sell him I think the market is very slow it doesn't look like he's going to go down in price ahead of the game week Two deadline but we got to keep an eye on that and he's a problem now yeah I mean I I can play Robinson but if you haven't got Robinson that's the move four five to another four five maybe Anderson uh maybe Maz rui as I said who could be a good option although the fixture next time out at Brighton is tricky elw for Liverpool although that was a big factor coming out the game Salah and jota delivered a call 0.85 xgi for Salah 0.99 for jotter and they just came alive in that second half and it was Trent who was the protagonist for me 106 xgi helped set up the goal with that delicious pass for Salah into the channel set up an incredible big chance of J that you put wide but Trent just came alive second half and that perhaps was can's presence in defense allowed him to get forward more and yeah Liverpool no real fears going into the brenford home game own in Salah and Captain in Salah even with Harland it switch the other player who stood out I guess is saos was in that 10 roll on the right hand side but didn't really hamper Salah getting into the box and getting chances so no fears there I don't think but sosai could be a 65 option worth looking at as for its witch I guess it was Hutchinson and Greaves who were the standouts gaves a former in Defender had a chance a set piece Hutchinson very Lively in the pocket another another five five option but they'll have easier games obviously not next week though because game week two of course they go to uh they go to to the EAD but it's a wait and see for it switch I [Music] think Arsenal walls it went according to the script didn't it um really routine victory for Arsenal in the end and sacka again like Salah one of the big assets for turning if you don't have S the numbers are pretty frightening five shots five chances created 0.73 xgi look the real deal for Arsenal just as we expected H's got his goal as well and got the 90 minutes which is really interesting and although he his average position was deeper he had 10 penalty area touches the most of any player so far and he had like I say he got the 90 hased Martinelli 7 million midfielder there probably worth watching too trai did come off the bench but came off to a play sacker with 10 minutes to go so not the changes we expect to Mareta maybe that means that Martinelli could be an option and havitz could be the Arsenal asset to go to if you can't stretch the sacker but as I said with those numbers I think you've got to stretch a sacker I think because he just looks he just started the season no fatigue signs at all uh defensively kept a clean sheet just as we expected yeah you could have written that script really [Music] another terrible start for Everton at home I think they've lost at home in the last three seasons now yeah Brighton just absolutely too good for them I kind of expected that but perhaps not by that 3-0 margin um J Pedro did okay hit the post but 0.05 xgi didn't show up too much other than that but encouraging I mean in that Brighton team if they're going to score goals he's going to prosper of course uh M to stand out or Mina um and also matoma so the two wide men really the standout players for Brighton who really just terrorized ever all day and young got sent off I think as an I said how is Young going to handle matoma and he didn't he got the red card of course which does give them problems I mean at right back they've only got whole gate now I think so they're going to go to Spurs and it be hallgate versus son that could change my plan about selling Tom um yeah Everton dismore um pford just had no chance for any of the goals really and bright and impressive and United at home next barco's admission of course is the big headline I guess from this game he was a much fancy forming Defender oh as as you did go in hard on him but yeah on the bench now we don't know what's happened there but what we do know it could be an injury but he played a lot preseason he looked really prominent was onset pieces for them as well and then hinwood comes in game week one now the worry is even if there is a little bit of a knock or fatigue you've got hinwood you got a Stan you could have a new signing coming in I think that yeah if you've got Barco because of his ownership I think he could go down quite quickly so that is a concern in the 4 million bracket uh I'd be looking looking to to ship him out maybe to Har Bellis who was prominent in the South Anton performance at Newcastle that was you very impressive the numbers are really strong Armstrong .79 xgi five shots looked very Lively indeed but again the game was skewed by the sh ending off of course newcast having had three shots in the whole game won it with an eak assist to Joe Linton I don't think we can take too much in the game other than santon perhaps we're underestimating them and as I say Armstrong and maybe small bone with the standouts and it's Forest at home next as a forest fan I was worried by what I saw from samp and put it that way as for Newcastle can't take anything from it I C in isach got an assist should have C in Salah but it's one of those things the sending off really to just change that game and change the [Music] output so I was at The Forest game of course and I saw wood get his goal a return for those who who went with him and I I mean I see the merits of it he he only had that one short in the entire game so chances on creating chances is going to be the issue or good chances for Forest um I think he keeps his place for the next two s Anon and walls but then after that a you did come off the bench and replace wood I think he will start to get starts from game week four on so just be wary of that gives white and husand and I were impressive enough look sharp three chances created each but as I said Forest really did struggle to to create guilt Edge chances that where they can score goals from bourou the same really um they've got a new Striker coming in EV I nson I think it is Big Money signing not in FB yet and I think we can't judge Bournemouth we see him settled in their standout I guess was seeno 5.5 midfielder had five shots on the day but generally they looked toofless without an out andout Striker so I don't think we can Jud take too much on this game and it's the same really for the West Ham V game the last game of Saturday Watkins started got an hour was kept C didn't even have a shot uh and Bo in the same for West Ham um didn't have a shot or chance created I don't think so was kept very quiet so while sacka and Salah at the top tier really delivered you know some of the other players Watkins and Bowen in particular just were kept very quiet on Saturday's matches Rogers I guess is the talking point he started the game as expected centrally rather than left playing just behind Watkins and I would say I saw enough to think that yeah he's the five million to go for or the player in the 5 million 55 bracket to go for could his place be under threat durang came off the bench and scored the goal but I just think that Rogers gives gives Emory that link player um that player that can link Midfield and attack where I think Duran's an outout Striker so I think Rogers is is definitely wor worth a look for Villa's really strong fixtures to come if you haven't got him already uh and bayy was the other real player that stood out for Villa um I love Bailey and I thought he had a really good game I think it three two shots and three chances created so if you can't get to what kins if you don't want to get to Rogers Bailey for Villa fixtures looks very nice indeed all right I've got to go cuz I've got to get to London to see uh PJ Harvey in concert which is very nice taking my partner to that missing the uh Palace or missing the brenford palace game missing Chelsea Man City quite pleased about that to be honest because as a nonh Harland owner not sure I want to watch that uh obviously I run the risk of if Harland goes mad at Stanford bridge I run the risk of my mood being killed while I'm out with my partner could be an issue how do you do it Mark how do you manage a relationship whil being obsessive fbl well my tip is on what I do is I'm just miserable all the time and then she never detects a drop in my mood uh join me tomorrow for more crucial tips like that Tuesday evening couldn't record on Monday because of the weather so the game week is now over and I got through Sunday without Harland uh at the at the gig of course and uh didn't have a signal so that wasn't too painful because I couldn't see the damage until after the match but as it turned out Harland just the one goal and I I'll take that to be honest U Chelsea kept him relatively quiet just um four touches in the Box 17 overall a couple of shots on goal it would have been awful to watch without owning him I know that and I know what's coming in its witch game week two but not too bad seveno return for Harland and overall City got the job done didn't they Chelsea didn't look too bad I I I thought they'd be more Resolute uh in this game than they had been in preseason and so it proved they kept they kept City at arms at for most of the match um Elsewhere for City Savio did look good uh wide right but got replaced in the end by foden at halim and you got to think foden starts game week two don't you really I mean more on that in a bit when it comes to my dilemmas as for Chelsea Palmer was kept quite some nice touches I mean he's Palmer right he's going to come good and I think from this game week onwards game week two the fixtures get a lot better for Chelsea and and he may be a factor wasn't a factor in many gameweek one lineups but there's no doubt a play of his quality with penalties is going to come into our Seasons it's just whether we need more time to look at mesa's Chelsea and I think we do because in kungu really sums it up he is a dilemma for those who went with him going week one because he was sub before the hour mark and it's just the number of options that mesa's got I mean inku was played out wide wide left it appeared and I don't know I mean out there there's just so many as I said so many options there juby Hall is there as well um is are they going to play Lavia and cedo uh and Fernandez and Enzo are in in the same team every week or is that just a team for City we don't know yet and because of the options available that Chelsea lineup is so hard to predict and overnight they were looking at getting Felix in with gallaga going the other way to Athletico so I don't know so many question marks over Chelsea and in kungu I just I don't want to go there as yet um but yeah as for City I don't know I I do want to look at an asset going into it which I do want to look at getting at least one of their players if it's not foden maybe it's going to have to be Lewis [Music] so brenford got the win in Sunday's other game 2-1 in boomo the standout I guess and and the emission of Tony from bren's lineup means inuma is going to get penalties makes him more attractive 7 million option No Doubt he's going to come into our thinking maybe in konas can look at him uh from game week six brenford fixtures look good yeah and like Palmer he's going to be a factor he's he's he's too much of a good player too much of a good fancy asset to stay out of our thinking for too long but I don't think we move into him just yet I don't see Tony getting back in that bord side he's going to be off I mean the fact he was omitted means he's an absolute noo um so he's being sold in droves I think that was a bad move if you went for him game week one um Elsewhere for brenford yeah Ian I mean it's it was a hard fixure to call I went one all 21 I'm not surprised by the outcome bit disappointed from Palace but a owners wow seven shots and of course denied that wonder goal from the free kick really really unfortunate again glad as a non-a owner I didn't get to watch that match firsthand but yeah I mean I think panace are going to be those sides that they're going to take time to settle down without Elis maretta back didn't play the full game but when he's back to full fitness and they've got their a play without Lis Palace will be a factor as well and no doubt e with the numbers he put up there yeah light and bumo has to come into our thinking finally on to Monday night's game and uh Spurs and Leicester I mean I went into that with porro son and salanki how I came out of it with just a porro goal I have no idea Spurs should have been runaway winners they were absolutely dominant and but Lester got the point and vardy with the gameweek one goal again only Salo I think that scored more game with goals game one goals than him and it was a Cooper performance from Leicester low block took their chance on the break and then look the most likely winners as it ran out but yes spurs in that first half should have got more than the one goal they got poo to stand out four chances created slanky was okay fre shots looked Lively enough I'm happy to hold on to him him son though very disappointing my strategy was take son into this game week move him out game week two to fod him but I've got a dilemma now because because Quanza looks like going down in price tonight so I said just 24 hours ago on this video it looked like he wasn't going to go down in the game week now with lots more sales the pricing models are showing him perhaps dropping tonight so I've got to decide whether I move off the four five Defender and go to maybe someone like Lewis um and get get some skin in the game at least for that City game with Rico leis but is he lik to start Walker was on the bench I don't know that's a risk to me I'm moving from one risk to another or do I leave con where he is hope that he breaks back into Liverpool team and stick to my plan go son to foden can I go into the match of the day challenge on Saturday without Harland and without a city player I it's going to be awful because that match of the day challenge has Forest play so Hampton I won't know the score there so I have the of watching that and then I'll have the agony of watching Man City against it witch without a city player I just don't know if I can do that so I've got to decide tonight what to do there um I'm Tor between keeping quansa and taking the drop uh and moving son to foden or making the more sensible move which is to just lock the money in and get Conor out I've got coner and I've got Robinson to cover in defense so with the porro injury it might be that I have to play conso against Arsenal then I'm okay I've got a back three all the way through to about game week eight or nine and by that point quansa could have worked his way back into lineup so I'm leaning towards sticking to the plan and going son to foden and at least having foden for that match of the day challenge um you're going to have to tune in for that to watch that cuz that's going to be a cracker for many many reasons I'm sure probably for the agony that I'm going to go through so join us for that but in the in shorter than that we're doing Black Box on Thursday me and as so look out for that Thursday evening where we're looking into the Quanza dilemma a bit more I may well have had to been forced into my transfer by then we'll have to see but elsewhere we're going to be spending yeah you know five minutes on the trouble I got people into wono and about 55 minutes to an hour maybe on Barco and the debacle that that as got you into yeah I know don't worry I'll make him explain to us all how that happened um yeah join us on Thursday for blackbox join us on Saturday for master day challenge don't forget to like And subscribe this video thank you very much see you next time,3894

everybody I was about to say I'm in the driving seat today I'm using some new tech and I don't know what the hell I'm doing but you know certainly the most important stream of the of the Season Mark how are you yeah what could possibly go wrong uh we've probably got more people watching than ever and uh yeah I've given the Reigns to you I'm okay I've just got out of work so I am I've completely missed the day in terms of what's broken today in terms of transfers injuries Etc so you need to catch me up on the news and I can tell you now I'm in a bit of turmoil I didn't want to go into fest with my with unknowns and decisions to make but I the way it's looking I'm going to be at fest tomorrow and I'm going to be in a hell of a state because we're going to be doing a round table an hour before deadline and in that hour I'm still going to be wanting to make changes I think so I am I'm not in a good place put it that way I take it you have had heard the news about your best your soulmate oh yeah who was gonna win U FPL little little Oscar Bob breaking his leg Yeah I mean that's the reason why I'm in turmoil because basically it's um that has ruined my plans I mean he shouldn't have been Central to my plans but it turns out that those those cheap enablers did unlock so many options and uh it's basically just yeah unfolded from there basically yeah we got loads of people watching only a thousand people watching um already this this slightly hastily construed stream today quite a few comments about your volume people are saying you're a bit loud which again yeah I turned myself down this end so I should be okay Josh 4T being up to hear Mark Clearly with the volume loud is the real revelation of this preseason yeah it's it's the hopefully the balance is good between us now let us know in comments hopefully it is yeah yeah let us know um so obviously we we've had a pretty good season a pretty good preseason of of content I think so far so you know if you're looking for some last minute advice do go back and and look through some of that uh today we're going to be talking through some of the big stories I think that have come through today we've had some press conferences we've had some new signings we've had some Shock of Revelations and what that might might mean and my Club have gone absolutely crazy and started signing everyone that hasn't helped has it that that that hasn't helped because Barco and Pedro were actually not main states but they were building blocks in our teams and then 24 hours before the deadline Brighton go you know what let's go and spend 100 million should we let go on let's do that let's throw FB managers in a turmoil and suggest that we're going to be again can't what did I describe you as a [ __ ] show of uncertainty probably har but that's what Brighton looks like someone else say with the the btech Chelsea which I really took to bch Chelsea yeah yeah unless they're saying that Chelsea are like you know not even educated and actually wear slightly better but I think they were using it in the other sense that you know they they they're the Highly Educated ones I'm not I'm not really um I'm not really having that yeah we're going to talk about that you've done some amazing stuff on pre-season looking at minutes and returns for anyone who's putting stock yeah into into things like that we can look back at some of the other stuff that we've talked about so far and then we're bringing back the predictions we've obviously got our predictions for Twist team yeah with a Twist absolutely y so yeah we got got quite quite a bit to get to um if you're liking and enjoying the stream do give us a like do drop us a comment as well do drop us a review if you're listening on podcast as always uh but yeah let's get into it right let's start with the news then let's start with with Oscar Bob uh fractured his his leg obviously devastating for him his opportunity to break into the team and you know put a bit of pressure on on everyone really because they don't they've lost Alvarez there's Bernardo Silva there there's obviously um what's his name the the new Brazilian Winger saevinho Savino yeah saino who's now obviously got his opportunity to to have a bit but yeah you were a big Bob fan I mean what do you think this means for City going forward in terms of you know the first few weeks and what they do in the championship window let's not let's not think he was a key player long term because obviously they've got lots of solutions but I think he was a key player going into the first couple of games because he's been their best performer in preseason he's obviously got that link up with harand being compatriot and so on it has worked well for them preseason I mean they they've got through preseason with a much depleted Squad because of obviously losing a lot of players to the Internationals but they've still impressed at times during preseason but Bob has been the highlight for them and pep would have gone into the season thinking Bob can carry some burden when it comes to creating chances for Harland over the certainly the first couple of games and I do think it is a disruption disruption for them because Savino is not ready to be thrown in I think he got his first minutes didn't he at the charity Shield um I still call it charity [Music] Shield the milk cup as well what is it now the Comm Community Shield right yeah Community Shield I sponsor yet it's not like the Borama um I do think that um because of that it will have disrupted City going into the Chelsea game because they now there's no question he was a starter pep would have had him in his 11 for Stanford bridge and probably it wi as well so I feel for the player first and foremost because he was about to have a breakout season you know if you listed the players that possibly could emerge this season as stars and he wasn't going to go and repeat Palmer's returns for sure no chance but I think he could have easily achieved double figures for either goals or assists if he'd got a long and off run in the team and he was showing the talent that could potentially stake a claim in the stting 11 not on a regular basis but in and out so over the season he probably would have scored 10 goals in all comps and and certainly assisted as well and now he's he's proberly gone for what three to four months we don't know we don't have the unless it's come out today the full prognosis real shame for the player he could have taken his opportunity and obviously for fbl it's a blow because he was a key enabler for me I don't know how many others were on him but I was certainly in that camp yeah I mean and the other implication of obviously is what does City do now because they already seem maybe a little bit light having sold Alvarez and injuries to greish and obviously they haven't got Rod back yet and other players you know might take a bit of time to to get up to Fitness hav I mean they bought sveno but not really anyone else to my knowledge think of anyone um so you know they haven't really invested to this this season and it had an implication on me because it's it's made me think or city gonna go out and buy someone now who do they buy we talked about on the last show do they go out and get e and I know he's not a right winger that's not his position but could they shift fod and back out right and play as a central and it's put some question marks around e for me which means that I've rejigged a load of players in my team so the 5 million Oscar Bob who you had in your team has made you make some changes it's made me didn't even own him make some changes so it's a massive I think everyone's looking at I right there was a lot of people on on X today saying they kept searching for E to city and that that does look like it could be a target for them and because they've got the option of playing Silva out Bernardo out on the right we were led to believe him and Luke did an excellent post about how he sees him lining up and he felt that foden and Bernardo would be used more centrally and it'll be Bob competing from the start with Savio on the right um Savio Sav Savio Sav Savio Savino I think that he's called Savio Savino isn't he or that's his nickname Savino that's his it's AKA Savino I think it is Savino call saino yeah um now he's not ready so he's not going to come in Bernardo presumably will start at Stanford bridge now and does it mean that foden has to come back quicker I mean I didn't really I didn't necessarily think foden would start against it which but I now think that he probably will have to um because Oscar Bob was you know he was providing a goal threat in preseason I think pep would have gone into the season thinking well without foden there Bob can fill that void in terms of replacing foden's goal threat he wouldn't be longterm foden will come into the team obviously but there's no question that they need goals other than Harland and he wants to have players in that team that can have a goal threat as well as Harland to distract if anything to distract Defenders from marking their key man and foden would have done that and will do that but Bob was doing that early on for the first couple of game weeks now he's gone who do they bring in who brings goals to that team exactly and and look at taking Alvarez out I mean Alvarez scored so many important goals from last season whether Harlem was injured or not you know I don't know how many go goals he got over the season but it must have been 20 20 to 30 I'd say over in all competitions so they need someone who they definitely need someone who can take because what happens if Harland gets injured that it's going to be what Bernardo Silva at false 9 or GRE like greish doku Bernardo none of these they got Nunes as well haven't they but yeah but none of these never been in favor none of these are 15 goal a season players I think I think they're gonna struggle to fill the void I just don't know why they wouldn't go out and get e if he's actually going to cost them like 55 60 million that's such a good price for him I mean they'll they'll know a release Clause if there is one and they'll go straight in with that I expect and so it has put it's put doubts in people's Minds about e as well because of we're expecting some form of move and who knows he might not line up at brenford because there's a move in the off in and Palace want to protect the uh the asset we don't know it's all speculative but the Bob injury has caused this this chain reaction of stuff crazy it's crazy is it I mean I don't love it because obviously it's a horrible injury for him but I kind of love the Carnage that it it sort of and the thing is I sent you I sent you a screenshot of my t team didn't I yesterday lunchtime and I said I'm sending you this because I think it's locked and I don't want you accusing me of cheating and copying others when you see this team elsewhere fours later the Bob injury broke and it's all gone out the window yeah and I was so settled I was so happy and now I so was I I was I was completely set until I had to take a out and it's made me rethink anyway we'll come on to our teams um in a bit we're getting some super chats in thank you very much I've got all of these pinned so after we've done this section we'll take those and yeah feel free to drop those in this one's a little bit more informal we got a bit of a structure but we can we can take super chats as we bit of a jazz jazz episode of blackb jazz episode that's it and then at the end I'm gonna put a post in the the Discord channel for Godfather tier patreon members and we're going to get a couple of the patreons into the into the chat as well so if you're interested in that head over to patreon uh sign up be a Godfather team member and join into Discord it could be a complete disaster Mark or we could uncover the next content Creator in the FB we could yeah which way can It Go I mean like which way will it go I mean it can't be as big a disaster as a certain stream we hav't even mentioned we even mentioned passwords I to come on I wanted to come on the stream today so we could just relentlessly mock him for it um if anyone hasn't seen it uh Andy who obviously hosts a scoutcast had a bit of a nightmare with with zoom and for some reason left all the cameras on and was talking to himself which involves the password for the Scout Zoom account guess when I'm when I'm talking to myself I'm normally reciting my passwords PIN codes Bank numbers that kind of stuff yeah so it was you you f me up this morning you like oh 3196 mother name is debah a lot of comments about E I was just speculating that that e could be on the move to city and as a result of that he might not start a brenford there's nothing in that it's just just speculation right no but you know and we're going to come back to the preseason lessons but if there is doubt play it safe that's what I just keep coming back to yeah uh right let's talk about Brighton then for those who've been following the the transfer news we yeah we've gone a bit a bit wild in the transfer market this this he 100 million yeah in the last in the last few days um got be one of the top Spenders in in the window right this this year are we the top spend in the window this year in the leue Chelsea surely are they don't even they don't even Factor they don't even count anymore uh we we've signed gr gruda from Mains and Herz is very excited about he described him as a street footballer his interview today but also said he needs time to to bed in so anyone that's worried about m in the short term I wouldn't be too concerned it's goingon to take gud a bit of a bit of time but if you've got five minutes go and watch his highlight re on YouTube he looks like the greatest player they all do they all do when you go on YouTube and watch the highlights there I know I know it was he scored some absolute screamers though for for Mains um but yeah we're expecting him to to compete with M on the right that's where he played for Mains or or play in the 10 as well which obviously puts more pressure on on J Pedro uh kadulu is is a big one a lot of people worried how that's going to affect Barco he's played predominant left back but he's a very versatile player if you look at his average his positions on on transfer market I've never really seen anything like it he's kind of played it literally everywhere and I still maintain our biggest weaknesses at right back and if we're signing someone who can play it right back that's where he'll play at least in the short term because so you're signing farco is not under threat you don't you think that kulu's arrival doesn't put him under threat well it puts him under more threat than if we didn't sign kadulu let's let's put it let's put it that way and I think it stupid hand's back in training but I can't see any world in which Barco doesn't start at least the first three games so have you check the pronunciation by the way we're getting we're getting we're getting pelters for mispronouncing the play kadogo that's right Kulu kadulu sh that's probably the worst mispronounce you kadulu wasn't that a band in the 80s I'm sure k k Kor very good yeah I mean he he he will put you know it's it's more competition it's obviously not ideal I just think and like I've said a few times that barco is he's he's a one-of a kind player and I think it would be a real shame if someone who looks like they they've been built to become a key player in the squad just suddenly doesn't play anymore and I know Stan's back and I know we're signing potentially a new left back but if that just suddenly means that Barco doesn't play I think that's a real shame given the preseason he's had given his clear ability in the side so a Stan could come in and play left Center back kogu could come in and play right back and then bco is not effective Barco could switch to Midfield or he could just get ousted straight away and I could be completely wrong but I I just two or three two or three weeks it's his place to lose I think yeah I think he starts the season there's no question and as long as he's um you see him as a short term but the big issue is that he's got 22% ownership now so there's a danger that he'll drop in price once he once he loses his start he'll drop in price so then the clock is ticking isn't it so you you've got to get rid then before you lose a not one and losing a not one can be really punishing and you don't necessarily want to be prioritizing subbing your four million Defender out as an early transfer so I'm really worried about it the trouble is and we'll look at it later the cast of four million Defenders isn't exactly littered with strong Alternatives is it no and I still I still think he's the strongest one because he I mean the short-term fixtures are you know with Everton and Manchester United the fact he's on Corners in those he could get an attacking return in in either of those two games the clean sheet might be a little bit harder to you know to to get but if he gets an assist or something then you're probably fine he's not going to drop because if a four million Defender gets something but it almost feels like there's a bit more pressure on him to get something in that first game because if he goes into Manchester United and Arsenal and then has all these players competing for his position and then he loses his plays in game week three or four then he's definitely dropping yeah a Defender can play well and impress a manager without giving us an FBI return so yeah it's no it's no I don't think you know that makes him more likely he's going to knock a corner in that gets us a go gets us an assist but so that's the you know I just don't know I I'm really worried now from what I saw today um there's yeah there's definitely risk I think if you if I'm I'm starting in in game we one he'll definitely play game week one that's fine game week two I wasn't planning on playing him anyway and then going forward I'll just kind of assist i' see where he is because if he does start strongly and he does go into gameweek four and five seemingly First Choice having had a really strong couple of games and then he's got what Forest at home and another home game straight after that then suddenly he's one of the best assets you can have so you're kind of risking a 0.1 drop for someone who could be really strong in a few weeks but I can completely understand why people are getting cold feet about it now because there's a lot of things happening which leads me on to R and J Pedro as well I'm really really surprised at this one um a 40 million pound signing of a number 10 potential number nine who leads fans think has a lot of potential but definitely isn't the finished article yet in terms of his finishing it's a lot of money for us to spend on someone like that and I just don't know what that means for J Pedro because Ferguson has been talked up today by by Herz we've got gruda and and Min on the right Pedro isn't getting in over Moma on the left so now there's three potential places in that 10 roll plus wck had a good preseason I think Pedro's in a void now as well I think he's more he's more of an a void than barco is he's a 10 R's a 10 right he's not an out andout goal scorer he's a Creator and I've seen a bit of him I've seen him play he's got technically really good player good awareness good touch um Good Feet and he he fits the bright and mold and you know he fits if anything deser Potter mold and obviously the new manager um is trying to maintain that I guess that kind of culture of what a Brighton footballer is someone who's very good technically creative and I imagine a young player who can increase in value which is what rter is yeah I think it does make Pedro a real risk now so again it's real it's a real late twist affecting a building block of as squads yeah yeah not great no not great not great BL thanks for getting the checkbook out right at the last minute exciting as a Brighton fan though we've got so many options now I'm not interested in that who's interested let another tactical analysis about Brighton no let's not do that yeah we were we were like last year in attacking positions and we've got a lot now so it's a better position to be in as a fan but yeah definitely as an npl player it's not ideal um Smith roow what did you make of this Marco Silva s Smith row it's going to be a process for him to be in his best physical condition but then he did go on to say he had an impact in preseason I think he got two and two didn't he but it's going to be a process for him to be in his best physical condition does that cast a bit of Doubt around minutes and no starts no good no no no worries don't try and throw me that one um I think that um he'll he'll get 60 70 minut well get he'll get 70 plus minutes at Old Trafford no question then yeah and the good fixtures are there for him so I'm not going to be put off Smith row no chance okay good no nor am I and I I think from what I gathered from that that um interview he's he sees him as such a key part of everything he's going to try and build with with fham going forward so even if it does take him a little while to get going the fixtures are there for him and I would have thought in a few weeks he's going to be established as you know one one of the best assets because yeah he's he's he's in my team now and I'm I'm happy uh man united they've signed delit and I'm gonna get this pronunciation wrong Maz RI that's okay did we we apparently been pronouncing routa wrong it's rout not rata by the way okay good so that's three and three yeah exactly yeah people don't come here for the pronunciations good job um yeah so again late disruption to the United Team I don't I don't think it affects our plans too much because apart from I got this Riot of all the ones today sorry interrupt just being told that I now that but yeah congratulations yeah apart from Bruno and gacho I don't think we were looking at United assets anyway I mean there may been people who are on Martinez in defense that this this influences obviously so no prices yet for these players so none of these players the Brighton signings all the United signings have gone delit init in at five oh is he he's in at five okay yeah you're not you're not going to look at that are you when you've got Martinez at 45 unless you feel Martinez is not getting into the 11 yeah which I don't think it's the case so it feels like feels like an okay signing delit he's he's obviously he a few years ago he was like the most highly regarded defender in Europe and I don't think his stock is well it's not anywhere near as high as it was back then but he's still an improvement on Maguire and Lindelof and Evans so you got to say it's a pretty decent signing right yeah and and Nigel Nigel the crab I call him Nigel because he's been around so long now um the lit is a threat from set pieces yeah of course yeah um but if I'm right in saying I think United's returns from set pieces are really disappointing last season I'm I'm just going to look now what the the goal returns were um yeah six goals from direct from Corners last season which is the fifth worst in the league only Burnley sheffeld United forest and Palace had fewer goals direct from Corners so unless they improve that I you're not going to sign a defender on the basis of threat from Corners are you so no not five million you can go and get moono can't you from Palace and I think that would be the preferred option in that bracket um or maybe even an Everton Defender over over United Defender I think I mean Martinez but four five perfectly good option yeah yeah yeah versus van dijk no definitely not more like to get sent off I think and then the final one I just wanted to flag was uh POA cogo on salanki uh seems pretty positive thankfully it's what we expect as top Pro good guy settled into dressing room really well footballing wise got great attributes that fit what we're trying to do there's a bit of an adjustment periods uh but we've seen that every new signing that comes in he's fited in really well with the group we still got a couple of sessions to go he should be good for Monday that's about as good as you could hope for right yeah I saw the quote and I presumed when Neil retweeted it that it had some shocking Revelation that would disrupt us but it doesn't I mean it BAS me means that I mean r charon's only just got back right so and he's I don't we'll see later I don't think he's played any minutes at all preseason so the only threat to San's minutes is keski I think keski won't start the game I've seen some predicted lineups of Spurs that have him out on the right I just don't agree with that because they war keski on the bench presumably to replace salanki late in the game so why would they play him out on the right and Rob themselves of that option unless for charon's going to be on the bench I don't know maybe he will be but he hasn't had any preseason minutes uh and as we know charon's injury prone so I think it'll be Johnson on the right keski on the bench and it'll be sanki will be preserved maybe with 10 15 minutes to go but I still think he can do a lot of damage against Leicester in even with the x- mins down to 70 75 which it might be but I still back him I'm going to predict kudi starting over Madison in the 10 yeah he could start in the 10 yeah I think it'd be very harsh to drop keski after the preseason he's had and Madison hasn't really delivered so I don't know it's hard you wouldn't go near even though would you it's or Johnson now again that's another Johnson was arguably like the best six five million midfielder a few weeks ago and now he's too risky to pick he is and and this is what we've seen we haven't really had answers over the last week we've had more questions than answers haven't we it's coming on a daily basis so um yeah I'm seeing some questions pop in do ask your questions because we can we can pin them and star them and then we'll come back to them later so um yeah do do send questions in I'm playing around with the stream yards pinning it's fun yeah are you okay very good um yeah so I see some questions going in there on Forest yeah Johnson would be better off on the bench maybe but he's played out in the right all season I just think Counterattack Pace you know some one side Johnson the other away from home I think Johnson's more suited kesi at home maybe to break down a low block but are they going to get a low block at Leicester maybe they will maybe you know maybe Cooper maybe I should know maybe he will come out first home game and just block the lowest of low which he he did do at Forest but I just I'd like to think they'd have a go at Spurs first game but maybe maybe that's wrong maybe they will low block and it' be kesi is needed to unlock it because might not be spacing behind and maybe yeah so again it's like you said there's uncertainty and so it's only really son who's nailed on to start and get good minutes salanki will start but how long will he get I reckon 70 at least yeah uh I mean I'm GNA go to super chats in a second but one from AFC Kirkham just says you think sonel is increased or dropped saw that after San's joined because i' I'd say dropped because I think sanki is better value now than son yes yes but at the same time you know early on in a way makes son maybe a better asset because he's yeah that's what I mean in the short term I think he's a good option now um because if if you're gonna I I do back the Spurs attack at Leicester I think they're G to score three goals and I was going to go Johnson now I can't go Johnson I'm obviously looking at salanki if I really want to back the Spurs attack you go sank and son not forever you have a plan to move son away but I I'm looking at potentially getting someone like son in or or Bruno in and move into foden um depending of whether I go in with Holland or not bit of a spoiler um but yeah I think son for the first couple of games is is a good option because you're right he's got he's got he's got salanki to serve and I I still think son away from home is a is going to be a big threat to Leicester regardless are playing out wide I don't I don't think necessarily they got they've got what it takes to contain him and then it's Everton at home isn't it so I think the first two son looks really good yeah there be some people they're considering going without harand and son and and just having son right yeah I've heard maybe I mean you know they're the kind of people who read passwords out on live on stream uh just to take some of the super chats thank you to Nigel the crab who's been a member with us now for 12 months uh on YouTube has now made the switch over to patreon as well so thank you for all your support Nigel he then went and gifted five memberships as well God on the [ __ ] coming on later is he coming on live yeah n want to come on have a look in the Discord find the link when I when I post it of all the people you you deserve to come on the most and have a chat with us exactly yeah we we owe him about two grand we're gonna have to buy him a drink at first yeah tomor uh subit super chat about Forest hi Mark what's your thoughts on Forest defense and Hudson adoi also on Trent and vardal thanks AP it's nice to know that my opinion is uh is is needed in um yeah I I think the forest defense will improve this year I think milinkovic is a good signing that should help with the set peace threat and that really I mean our exg last season was really good was fifth or sixth in the league so if we address the goalkeeper issue and I still think it's an issue and I think we will I think we will get a better goalkeeper in before the before the window closes do you think you think sells starts the season though right he has to because that's all we've got but I think it'll be either Johnston or ramsdale through the door before the before the transfer window yeah but it's important position I think you know I think that yeah I think it's necessary it's not essential for us but it's necessary We Do It um what's the point what was the point of mguel then well I think that was a um an opportunity he had release Clause that was ridiculously low and we see him as someone for the future we can resell basically he had a release Clause yeah he's young I think he's like 22 23 he had a release Clause of 40 million and then they changed the Clause to 5 million and we found out about it and we got in quick and so I don't know why they changed the Clause some his agent did and we heard about it and pounced so I think he's an investment he may even go out on loan I don't know he wasn't in the squad for the last couple of friendlies I think the forest defense is worth an investment once it settles down we're looking at a left back so that puts some concern over Williams and Ana who will start I think Ana is nailed but I wouldn't go for him yet if you have to get a Defender now if you want to go the forest defense now you go Murillo is probably the one who's most likely to start every game he's the he'll score he'll score a cracking goal he will score a goal that will be on Match of the day um this season in terms of all you know match of the day focused B I want a goal for Murillo and he's hopefully his transfer value goes up another 10 million because like Fabian Sher isn't he like you just know he's got that ABS yeah he's got one in him it's coming this season for sure at least one so y he's even on free kicks like preseason Gibbs white rolled him and he took a 30 yard free kick on goal so he's determined to score it's coming yeah uh Trent versus vadio I'd rather get Trent I'd rather pay the million more for Trent um I'm just buying into the slot Revolution um I think Trent will play the right back role and I think inverted right back is his best position I think he can be creative that side and that side he'll have Salah and soosai and I think they are very talented players and I think the three of them will cause a lot of problems for a lot of teams so I like Trent vardo was brilliant as well but we do know what we don't know is the rotation with the Champions League whether vardal is going to be affected in some way by that um you know we don't know where he's going to play is he going to play on the left we presume he's going to play left back um but pppa has options there I I I want to give it a bit more time before we consider vardal because yeah you're showing in the Champions League dates so it's game week after game week four we'll get the first round of matches then game week six and seven the second round so if you're wild card in for game week eight you'll have a bit of information on that if you're wild card in after game week three into game week four you don't know anything about how that rotation will affect things maybe we can't tell but vardal isn't going to play 38 League games in every Champions League game is he so whereas Trent Trent is going to play every League game when he's fit so think he's he's more nailed than vardal in term o over long term and I think if you're signing Trent or vardal they're long term right you in you intend to hold them for the entire season I would say I think vardo is obviously G to be a massive factor for us maybe even in a couple of weeks but I think you can afford to start the season without him given the the options we have in Trent and you know even like celba I'd put I think I'd put both of those ahead of vardal because we don't know what vel's position is going to be until they get all their players back but if he's playing at Center back he's you know if if it's CRA at Center back or vardo at Center back I'd rather go celra because Arsenal got a better defense obviously vardo was playing at left back and rolling up like he did towards the end of last season it's a different story but we don't know what that's going to be like we don't know how City are going to start the season and settle and but we do know that Trent is going to be very involved in everything and that Arsenal are probably gonna keep two clean sheets in three uh given they've got Brighton and Wolves yeah and and in terms of sample size data we've got far more on Trend right and we know he's pretty consistent season to season and so yeah I'd rather put the money there early on and then see what we get from vardal over a bigger over another set of data this season yeah there you go agreed uh next question this is from Albin federick thank you very much for the Super Chat by the way Mark we have 2,170 people watching it's embarrassing isn't it and all we're doing is turning up and asking answering a few questions now we have got some more screens don't worry we have done some work you know at this stage though I kind of feel like you know people have absorbed a lot of information they you know all the stats and things that we've done all that it's kind of now just the point of the final touches isn't it to to the teams other than you I think most people have hopefully got their structures sorted at this point and you know and it's it's you say the final touches I feel like um some kind of um protester has broken and throwing soup all over my my painting yeah well you're you're debating no Salah no Harland all of this stuff I know that I'm going with harand and no sellah so I kind of feel like I've got that structure um right you're putting pressure on me to go without Harlem for the match of the day challenge aren't you as well so I'm feeling that pressure yeah I know I know it is I know it is but then I then I go into it's season five yeah yeah but then I consult the robot and what does the robot say he says you know don't find the voice then he says don't go Sal I I'll try and follow you leave me alone there you go did that work okay it worked perfectly but I wish it had got stuck so the robot is saying go sella now which is um yeah it has been chopping and CH it's so close isn't it between the two of them it's very hard to to know what is optimal at the moment so yeah yeah know cool talk about what this is from Alin best 65 mid after en kunu also best 45 Defender I mean guess the first question is is enu still the best 65 mid together I think La last week I said in kungu um sabosa who I was considering and Bailey obviously you've got Gibs in there gacho uh anyone else a 65 well we talked about Brennan we talked about Brennan didn't ween saos is in there as a dark horse as well I'm sorry I don't listen to a word you say it's fine gamesand andu is the best 65 option is he the best 65 option to start with that's debatable I think probably I think probably Gibbs Wyatt is the best over the first few fixtures because of forest fixtures I I and he's got pens and Inu hasn't plus we haven't seen in kunu in RCA's Chelsea yet Chelsea have I mean Chelsea have only signed what 17 players in the last 48 hours so you know there still still a little bit of uncertainty um I think I think he's going to play as one of the tens or one of the eights or whatever you want to call it right he's not he's not going to play out front um down the middle I don't believe he's not going to play out wide because they they've options in those positions I think he's going to play alongside Palmer or or juby Hall he's going to play he's gonna play two of those three basically um in kungu could play in a variety positions though he should get plenty of minutes and he's been I think their most he's had the most minutes preseason for all the Chelsea players and we know what he can do his Bundesliga record was was superb we haven't seen it translate yet to the Premier League but we expect this to be a breakout season so I'm expecting him to be the best six5 option yes would I go with him over Gibbs white to start with no but I would definitely plan to move to inuko two or three weeks in because Chelsea's fixtures I mean you can show the ticker very strong so yeah God don't give me tasks to do best four five Defender let's let's look at that best four five Defender for me is uh yeah let's look at Chelsea's fixures there that's a bit blurry what's going on why is it so blurry my screen no is it okay oh yeah it's it's getting there for me so Chelsea's fixtures from game week two are very strong and we know that so if you don't start vunu and I I'm not going to but I'm definitely gonna have a plan to move to him for the palace game probably um as for the best four five Defender I actually think that's quite easy it's jel coner for me because I think that he starts for Liverpool and I do expect Liverpool to progress defensively this season I think under slot they will have more control more possession and um they will concede fewer goals as a result and I think cono at four five is a bargain sure there you go yeah I mean I I I don't really I I think enu is the best option I would start with him over over Gibbs white I think he's just the one that you get and I think he's got the biggest potential we're going to look at our predictions obviously in a bit and I think there's goals in that City Chelsea game I think that could just be any any any score line yeah if rodri is not back uh I think it could be anything enku is definitely my pick of the of the six fives then I think it's then I think I'd take a punt on Bailey I think given that yeah it's three weeks and he's quite fun and then it's really good fixtures after that in terms of the 4 five option I like Robinson Robinson's the four the only four five Defender got and fulham's fixures are incredible from gameweek 2 to about game week six or seven so I think they would be my my pick so yeah we're completely yeah completely different in that no I like it I mean I like bayy and gameweek three so you can get on that Villa fixed to run without having to invest in Watkins and if you can't get to Watkins and Bailey's great for that yeah um I don't know if I mean but that is also when you'd be looking at Inu I think because City Home Wolves Away yeah he could get things in both games but I think it's that it's that run after after that Palace Bournemouth West Brighton that you won him for so there's a conflict there on where you go it's interesting isn't it because I'm you know when I talked about having J I was engaged in I engaged with some people that I shouldn't have engaged with apparently you know you were saying in in WhatsApp and um on on on Twitter you're so sweet because you're so like innocent and naive when it comes to Twitter I'm like why is Mark talking to that guys worst toxic accounts out there yeah little with him I was like on Scout wasn't no when we had trolls on the comments I was in there every day replying to the trolls and then Joe came along with his band stick and um yeah so and I like that on Twitter I just give everyone the benefit of that that's a perfectly innocent question but it's slightly wound me up so I'm going to reply for the next four and a half hours I don't I don't do anything like that at work but certainly when I get home I like to post or at lunch and and yeah some there was a talk about well if you go jotter why are you going J he gets injured he's not going to give you I mean I was going J because short-term move and they seen that reluctance to go oh don't book in a transfer and it's like my point was what are the chances that we get to gameweek three and we look at our Midfield that we picked in gameweek one and we go no absolutely no one I want to change in my Midfield there's not a single Midfield there's not a single Midfield bandwagon that I'm nervous about and want to jump on no absolutely not I'm going to keep the same five midfielders I picked in game with one that's not going to happen of all the areas of our team the area that we are likely to be most volatile in is going to be Midfield because our defense will probably go quite big we'll have porro and Trent and some settled four FES up front we'll go Harland salanki um isak maybe have a plan to get Watkins in so those two areas defense and forwards are going to be pretty solid and I think we will get to game week three and not necessarily have to make changes there Midfield all over the shop there's a whole cast of of players who could catch our eye go up in price Rises there's no way we're not making a Midfield transfer for 75 or below by game R fre unless unless you're doing the thing that we talked about which is no I'm not going to make a transfer I'm going a wild card between three and four and carry roll over fair play if you're going to do that but I think you might miss out on a few opportunities if you do and that's just the mid price and and budget options let alone when the premium options start coming into into effect as well when foden's back if you got if you haven't got sa St scores Palmer is obviously no one's got Palmer at the moment within the Scout Twitter circles but you know if he comes off the bench and scores against Man City and then he's got the run that Chelsea have got we might all be clamoring for for him so yeah it's GNA get it's G to get very interesting um we have to speed up a little bit with these super chats Mark or we're we're gonna We gonna be let's just keep going it's all good um loads there's one there what is A's drink of choice tomorrow at F yeah what is your drink of choice tomorrow are you going to be on there's no Shots by the way there's no there's no shots no no I think no I think they can only do um I think I wanted to say Jager Bombs maybe they can do them they did say they can't sell shots I don't know why some rolling they can't sell shots so okay special Godfather tier license to sell you know what I'm kind of I'm glad of that in a way because I always end up doing it get messy won't it yeah yeah and I always end up doing them at like 10 o'clock and I'm already drunk and I'm about to I'm going to be leaving in an hour and I do like four Tequilas and I wake up feeling terrible know what be on it's cocktail it's two for one cocktails isn't it yes cocktails that's what I'll be on as well yeah I'll need on as well be on the cocktails I just know how many people go into the Mana match with like two or three players you know like there could be some like garnacho some Bruno Fernandez's some muneses some Smith Rose I'm tempted I'm temp I know it shouldn't be but I'm tempted to pick a player just to have someone in the match because it'll be nice to have that well Smith Ro going be on my bench horrible yeah yeah don't like that uh Allan says let's go best FPL stream there is thank you very much the views are still creeping up we're only at two and a half thousand which is crazy unbelievable there's nothing on TV again clearly fair enough yeah do uh do give us a like if you interested do check out the fo blackbox Godfather tier patreon as well for things like the prediction League which we be talking about in a bit FPL league with great trophies Discord Channel and other benefits we will be doing a good meet up next season as well so you need to be a member to hear all about that this is from F Gaza Mark what about Anderson at Forest to replace Bob at five million no not yet I don't know if Anderson starts uh game we one I think he should I think he's been good enough preseason to W the start but it might go to Danilo and then Anderson's on the bench to come on for one of the Wingers probably Hudson Ado with 10 minutes to go 15 minutes to go uh when he gets in the team and when he cemented his start which will come then he might be worth a look but um there's Amad Dio at 5 million who's probably the most likely to start for United early on I don't think he's a keeper but he's one I would go with in that bracket to start with and Rogers is the one to go with I mean people will say well why are you worried about losing Bob you can just go straight to Rogers I had both Rogers and Bob that's why I was that's why my team was sced I was starting with both of them um and now I will probably go in with Rogers he's he's the best five million option watch is Bob and Smith row you have all three yeah yeah yeah yeah I was going I was going all out I was like yeah I was all out risking risk it for the biscuit I was I was I was going to bring it on at Fest I was going to put that team up and just take the flag and um days aren you yeah I am that's all I'm all for the views and clicks yeah could do um but yeah I think that you go Rogers in the five million bracket there's no point in looking at Anderson yeah clicking back to the live chat and it just it highlights a random comment and that one was high beardy talking to you is he talking to me talking to you could be I think your Beard's a bit bit longer than mine is it at the moment Andrea is saying Mark saved by the injuries how dare you and I mean I think it was um who was it someone asked do you do you really think that was a good plan if you Alliant on Bob and a lot of people said yes I was going to win fbl and not me but some people did you don't know do you don't know i' got to be honest I was I was never considering Bob and I did feel like it was a bit of a disaster waiting to happen for people did disaster he's he's 0.5 more than Harry Winks how is he gonna be how's he gonna bring your season down to be a disaster well people would have played him gameweek one and two and he gets nothing against Chelsea and early subbed and doesn't start against IP switch selling Watkins for salanki and watching Watkins get a hatrick that's a disaster that's what we did last season wasn't it yeah I don't want to talk about any of that the amount of players I sold before big Halls was uh yeah pretty pretty instrumental in in the failure that was my season uh thank you for the massive Super Chat from Kenneth 999 good luck for new season boys and thanks for all the improvements to keep us engaged have we made any I mean we made the stream streamyards an improvement although everyone yeah that one is I don't know what resolution you got anyway yeah thank you Kenneth um my screen honestly I don't know what improvements you're referring into I don't think that as and I have improved too much but we'll try very kind to give us a compliment but we'll see we'll see what we do five years we can you believe we're going into our fifth year of Black Box yeah it's two old isn't it as well I'm quite nervous now I was um I was not nervous when I had my team settled now I'm like so uncertain about what I'm GNA I'm really I can't find a team I like at the moment and you saw you saw a glimpse of mine and you said I like that so maybe I'm wrong maybe I'm being hard we'll see what the viewer and the reader thinks or the reader The Listener I I when you when you you you set it up for me to hate it and I looked at it and I thought actually that's that's all right as a as a he goes yeah we talk about the bit let's have a look at some content though we we've taken a lot of yeah we've done a lot of questions we'll come back to I'll pin that one because I like that one gon versus we've got another six or so um super chats to to get we'll be here till 11 o'clock let's just go through the night you know I've got nothing else to do gonna be late so much to do you got to do your F PR I know but I'll get it done I'll just be up to early morning I've got tomorrow off work and you know I haven't had any food so I'm going to get Delirious soon so then I could come out of anything and make any bringing your pizza didn't you say that she's apparently well I don't know I I texted her but she didn't respond so I don't know how to take that yeah you ain't getting a [Laughter] pizza even here tonight she won't bring me any pizza we're all all I'm on my on my last beer as well uh right this is your pre-season data so again I was looking through this I was like this is some excellent uh excellent research you've done here so this is obviously the players and minutes and returns right all all in one one handy table Yeah so but what you're showing here I think is um yeah these are the returns over the pre-season um but which which one are you showing here you're showing the um I'm trying to say yeah you're show what you're showing here is the players with the no this is the this is the players with the fewest minutes preseason but the highest price so it's basically highlighting players to avoid um with game week one potentially right so these players are all priced High they're in price order Palmer at the top but with the lowest minutes with less than 90 minutes in preseason so all these players have less than 90 minutes I was surprised that M charlon there you see he's had no let's read let's read through these I think I think these are really interesting um so Palma foden de bruyne that's why we're not seeing many teams with those three even their key assets Watkins with not perc no minutes at all for fory Watkins which might 41 41% ownership 41% but could mean Rogers up front I think it will I think that Rogers will get we'll get an hour up front yeah I imagine don't you I mean do you see Watkins starting no I don't no I think just starts up front um matto been at the the Olympics uh Jackson's played Just 7.6 % which opens the door for en kungu to start up front Anthony Gordon he only played 45 minutes he is a bit of a risk given there's Barnes and Murphy who have both looked looked good um Tony Diaz was was surprising and obviously he's been off with uh with Colombia but yeah he's only played 62 minutes but managed two goals in that in that time bow starts Bowen starts gakpo doesn't doesn't salanki he's played Just 90 minutes then going down the list we've got e interestingly obviously off with England again he's played Just 61 minutes garnacho 32 minutes uh calori who we think might be an option at some point but probably isn't for now because we think zenchenko is probably going to start a left back and trippier he has played 68 minutes but potentially leave rento at right back and Hall at left back so there are some big names there and like a 35% ownership sanki 26 Gordon 30 tribia is 14% owned I don't think he'll start I think he I think the only player here that I would say won't start possibly is Watkins um highlighted I I think I expect Gordon to start I expect salanki to start R Charon will be on the bench I expect e will start Garo will start cury probably won't Chia probably will so there's not many of these but I think that Watkins is a really interesting one CU under normal circumstances you wouldn't expect him to start because no preseason minutes surely he won't but he's so vital to Villa and they're not going to play Duran because of the you know the the summer he spent trying to Edge his way out the door so they can only play Morgan Rogers up front which isn't ideal but he has starred in preseason I've heard some Villa Fans Say Yeah Rogers will start up front but you know it it's it would be a surprised if Watkins didn't get on the pitch and sure he will but just how many minutes will they give him can they take a risk without him at West if they're at home I don't think he starts away from home maybe he does I don't know I think it's worth going with Rogers though I think he'll get some minutes up front for sure yeah so do I um Gordon was someone you had in your team last time I can't remember if he's made the cart for you this this second time round or is he is he out he's in and out um I think that um yeah there's some concern isn't there and it's like 7 I I mean ordinarily again you start him in a home game we saw how strong he was his home form when we did a previous episode and um sthampton is a promoted team I imagine I mean I'm predicting a big win for Newcastle and Gordon should contribute but are we absolutely certain it's because of Murphy's preseason we're going to see the number of returns that he was the biggest performer in terms of returns in preseason so Murphy's an option for how and he can play Barnes on the left I've seen a lot of people say that goldon will start on the left Mur on the right um and that could be the way it goes I think he I think he will start but he won't he could possibly be just Spar the last 30 minutes if they're winning the game coasting then he won't you know he'll his x-min will take a hit and we'll see Barnes on I expect yeah quite a few people comment about the blowing of the chart on my screen on streamyard it looks perfect I've just checked YouTube it is super blurry I don't know why so there's nothing I can do about it this stage we have noticed since we've switched the stream yards we have had some blurry images we thought it might be to do with like latency settings on YouTube but they're all right my end I've just checked my my download upload speed all looks perfect don't know why it's so blurry basically I'm afraid there not not a lot we can fix it on the fly it will be it will be better when they get the HD version um but yeah it's obviously as is hosting for the first time tonight as well so there might be something in in the transfer of the files and so on but there's not a lot we on the remember the first few first few you streams were quite blurry but then it got better on on like the third one so yeah not sure not sure why all we can do is press the cameras are fine but the screen isn't U let's take a look at the second blurry chart then this is on uh pre-season returns ordered by preseason returns and there is a 5.5 million asset at the top of this with eight returns yes Murphy 1.5% ownership yeah unbelievable um yeah I mean he's definitely going to start game week one you think you think that's sure so you think Barnes will be on the bench and yeah okay Murphy and Gordon I think start start that one um kesi obviously had a great preseason six returns for him just 2% own I see Del in the chat has got him but maybe getting a bit a bit nervy about his his minutes uh Harland Rogers Min and wood all with five and Bob unfortunately who's now injured I didn't realize Rogers had five return five attacking returns in preseason it was that many yeah he's been he's been start and I and I watched the planet fbl um correspondence stream on Villa really good Villa fan talking on that and he left me in no doubt that Rogers is a player we should look at I mean I think we we've talked in the previous episode about there'll be likly be early band wagons and there'll be likly players that offer value and likely it's a midfielder or one or two midfielders like M for me Rogers is the one now Bobs out the question Rogers is the one that is most likely to go off early and set the bandwagon rolling so and I I really think we need one of these price points in our team it might not be we get the right one you can go Min to start with and then move off m to the to the bandwagon that's kicking off but I know from experience the cost of of sitting and being slow on a bandwagon and then watching them increase in price and watch them continue to return and then you have that reluctance to go in late because you're spending 0.4 0.5 more than people who got on early it's a horrible feeling it's like well if I'd have gone in game week two I'd have got them for not one or even for base we've all been there as well that's like classic isn't it and then you don't you even you make it even longer before you commit and then before you know it that player is pivotal to your success you know Palmer was a good casing Point most people got on Palmer early on but if you didn't and you hesitated yeah it was it was painful sorry uh other someone asked what the what different colors mean we've basically harl anyone that we think is an option essentially for for the start of the season um I'm going to come back to a player who's who's just a bit short this list would wood is there with five returns as well we think he's going to start over over taiwo at least initially until while he builds up Fitness inu's got four Returns the same as isak son htz kamada is interesting especially if e leaves that's another five .5 million asset we talked about him on the on the last show j's got more returns than sellah salah's played 75% of available minutes and got three attacking returns J's played 44% available minutes and got four returns which is nice Lis Hall three attacking returns for him in defense with Southampton up top and definitely going to start in that one but I wanted to mention emomo because isn't he yeah he's he's brenford have not have been awful defensively pre season but pretty good attacking wise he's got four attacking returns he's 5% owned it's very low isn't it I guess I guess it was like we don't know Tony's starting so he doesn't have the pens and that's a big factor if you remember Ando last season the pens played a really big factor in his early season form he can provide off um open Play threat he's he's he's clearly outside of Tony brenford best player Beyond set plays as well some the fixtures aren't superb for brenford they're not terrible they're midlin aren't they but yeah he's been overlooked 7even million is a good price for him because if he was 65 it would be an absolute no-brainer seven makes you think and unfortunately there are better options yeah Gordon and E in particular who would you rather have e or and Boomer over the season well in bumo without penalties is no competition because you go e so yeah if Tony leaves then suddenly things open up for him didn't they but while Tony's there P he's taking the pens isn't he um yeah I it's hard to know brenford they're not a team I'm going towards apart obviously fen's got a lot of traffic so I understand that but I don't think many are looking at many are looking at their attacking players at all yeah I I like aomo at seven even even without pens I still think he's he's a bit of a differential there's a few people in the chat saying they've uh they might you know they're taking a bit of a pun in them but yeah 5% ownership is is incredibly low it's very interesting looking at this this chart because it's kind of not really correlating with ownership is it it shows like obviously preseason is a big factor for us but you look at the top what's that top six players here in terms of attacking returns and other than Harland it's Rogers with 8% ownership the rest wood has 5% M has 1.4 keski has 2.6 so all of the best pre season form players aren't really being backed by by a more engaged crowd as well yeah it's not been a major factor is it I think obviously in the bubble that we live in on Twitter we are you know we're perhaps affected by it more than most we we follow Scout and we follow all the news and we you know we have to gather the information so we're aware of preseason form but the the main the mainstream players not necessarily taking that in and maybe that's a good thing there's a lot there's a lot of theories that support this is just noise and certainly preseason form should be ignored and and I understand that I think every now and then though you get a player who does come through preseason and then produces I was reminded I think Nema mentioned Ben Rama a few seasons back um my last good season was when I got a Ben Rama early and I think he scored at Newcastle in the opening game yeah remember and then he went on to have a good run he only had a run of three or four games where he returned value but that was enough to get me 15 20 points and earn me n0.1 0.2 on him and and that came from his preseason form so every now and then it can come in so I don't necessarily subscribe to the fact that preseason form is useless it's hard to pick the player who will carry that form into the season if form is a thing I mean it's all down I guess the X Factor is confidence right are there players out there who produce more output because their confidence is boosted by preseason form old school theory that if a striker scores three or four goals in preseason he goes into the season with confidence and he's more likely to score the numbers the algorithm people will poo poo that and say that shouldn't be a thing it's just noise but for some players you've got to think that is a factor and Ben Rama was was an example of recently but overall we look at this and it means little Ben Ben Rama strikes me as a bit like Jacob Murphy potentially in the sense that you know it's a player who was kind of trying to get into the sides like Murphy is he's kind of got opportunity now he's had a good preseason if he gets a couple of goals early in the season then maybe he he nails down that spot on on the right because you know there isn't a lot of competition on the right for Newcastle is that there's it's what it's Barnes and alaran yeah but he could end up he could he could end up they're going to sign somebody there is no question they're going to sign a right winger no question it's well known they're going to go into the market so before the window shuts they will they will spend 40 50 million on someone I expect they'll go big on that position wi we got about 10 they canose they can choose yeah and and um I expect that that that Murphy's start will be under threat very soon um but then you know equally they could play Golden and Barnes if they wanted to as well so there is some rotation this there I don't mind Murphy as an early season one on two game week pick but they've only really got that good fixture initially um I think after that the fixtures on they're okay but you I think they're way who they way to second game Newcastle I think it's I want to say West Ham but I'm a Bournemouth right okay tight pitch don't know don't know what they get there yeah I mean that's not a terrible fixture so Murphy for the first two is worth a look but expect them to sign a right wing and him to be someone you need to move out but that's okay there's plenty of options in that bracket so let go okay I think the outlier to that is is en kunu because he's played 98% of available minutes he's got four attacking returns and his and his ownership is 177% I think if en kunu had barely played in preseason and hadn't been scoring I don't think people would I think it's only be about half that so he's the one that I think people have looked at said okay he's fit now because that was obviously a big worry with him and he's getting the minutes oh and he's scoring that's made him such a good asset for the start of the Season yeah and and we had he had a sparkling preseason last time out and then got the injury so he was in a lot of our squads during preseason and obviously we had to remove him and it's happened again he's been impressive in preseason so can he carry that for if he didn't have City opening day he would have 25% ownership I expect but that City fixture just gives you that gives you that idea or that inkling that you can you can probably do better in the short term yeah yeah still think there's goals I still think there's goals uh Duncan please don't sing the cuara song it's embarrassing and his advert frust Strayer made me cringe harder than anything I think I've ever cringed that in my life so we'll have less of that on the channel final preseason table we have is the 4 million options I think Ben Johnson is now probably clear as the top option which makes me feel really sad to say given that Barker and how much I've been singing his praises and the fact he's at 21% ownership but I do think Johnson is if you just want someone who's just gonna play he's probably one there howood Bellis as well you know 65% it's who's the other Bell cot chaps off isn't he but Harwood Bellis is is obviously going to be key for the 11% ownership but yeah I mean if you what I mean by four million players is the best one is if you have no intention of playing them and you just want them to sit on your third bench for the next six seven weeks until your wild card I would go Johnson if you want a shot of someone with a bit more upside and you might be wild carding a bit earlier then go for Barco which is what I'm doing actually I'm G have them both um but if I if I was going to pick one I go Barco just for that potential upside but I think Johnson is the safer four million pick yeah I mean the trouble is it switch and S are going to concede a lot of goals so there'll be times where you think I'll be better off not playing them and not taking a hit losing points so yeah they're not they're certainly not guaranteed to get you two points when they come in these two um so a lot of game weeks they'll pick up a single pointer or worse I imagine Howard Bellis probably has well he does have more threat going forward because Johnson plays on the right and we know that life Davis will push up on the left and Johnson will probably have to be pinned back with the center backs so I imagine if you were choosing one of these two I would go Harbor Bellis for the set pieces because at least there something there in terms of upside on top of the clean sheet potential which will be very low I think for both of them mosir looks like he's going to start the season for wolves and could keep his place but wolves have got the worst fixtures of all the teams over the first six so you know short-term returns are going to be minor as well and he might not hold his place because you know you can expect wolves to go shopping in that area they lost kilman so and there's uncertainty on who gets in you know who who are the first choice center backs there at walles has got preseason minutes um 335 58% of the preseason minutes so he looks likely to start season but is he a long-term pick after the window probably not so yeah har Bellis will probably my choice now wow exciting stuff uh Ben Haley has asked who's as the reason I flagged this one is because I'm pretty sure and this is a massive coincidence that Ben Haley is someone I work with who has now discovered my who discovered this stream uh and I know they're out for some drinks tonight which I said no to because I want to miss out on you know Thursday night black box so if that is you Ben hope you're having fun with the explor lot and yeah thanks for tuning into the stream if they all just sat around in a p watching this on the stream then that's hilarious um Chris Dana saying nedovic is one to watch he is so there's a there's a lot of talk this 18yar old could house Matty cash for the right back role that's if con doesn't play out there um so he could be one to watch but not one to get in from the initially um he has played it preseason he is a real promising player a lot of the Villa fans saying that they prefer him to start right back over cash if that's going to be the case but you've got to think that cash starts even though we're led to believe cash is perhaps due for past year's new soon NE kovic you're right Chris is is one to watch yep uh right let's take some more Super chats so we' got a bit of a break until we get onto some other bits let's take this one from chrisc Cross just saw Phillips did it switch sounds good does sound good I'm happy for him seems like a well I mean a downgrade for Man City but I think it should hopefully be a good move for both parties well we we would have won the Euros had he been in the England team so um yeah I i' don't know what's gone wrong mvin Phillips he obviously had the seasons where he looked like he was England's you know in in the defensive Midfield Ro for England and going to city and could do great things never really got anywhere near their first team and rodri obviously dominant in that position you got to think that he'll have a Renaissance and he'll I think it's a smart signing by it which he's a player who's got something to prove didn't didn't work at West Ham though did it when he went there no it didn't um and again he had he had competition for his place there um whereas it's which I know they where we know from talking to Dan the Midfield area Central Midfield area is the one where he felt they were weakest so this is not a this is recruitment we expected to see and it which are shopping in that market where if they're going to sign somebody it's got to be a player that you know Phillips has got good pedigree but they're only going to get that type of player if they if they're on their trajectory is on the down and they've got something to prove and they could it's like the Barkley sign in for Lo look what happened to there they signed a player there who was a shadow of his former self will be fought and then then then they led to his Renaissance he had a fantastic season now going to be playing for Villa in the Champions League same could happen to Phillips and I guess what is which they're gambling on and I think they've moved smartly over the summer I think they've they've not done what Forest did which was to go mad and throw as much [ __ ] at the wall hope some sticks they've done they've done Strate I've said it twice now we'll probably get taken down by YouTube yeah um but um whether Phillips will give them the answer it is a gamble there's no question but I think it's a smart signing yeah you want move to do you want to move to the start screen so we don't have a blurry table on the on the yeah good idea yeah yeah there you go we'll sort that next week don't worry we'll be back with non blurry Graphics next week don't worry is it blurry on your screen on streamyard yeah a little bit but I'm taking putting that down to your internet connection so that's all fine we'll sort for next week yeah uh Bowens ask Steven gallager hi guys has Bowen been in your thoughts at all just be made Captain I believe of of West Ham 75 done well for us in previous Seasons I've not once flirted with the have he's been in and out my team in the last 24 hours actually who has yeah it's true the thing is um he's proven right he's a he's a strong very strong attacking asset he was in he's in you know he'll be in the top 30 for xgr non penalty all season in that Midfield table that we show the non- blurry one that we show as a season start um he won't get he's not on set plays where he's not he's on corners but he's not he's not going to be on pens he is going to be part of a West Ham team that look exciting they look like they're going to score goals from the signings that they've made and the potential lineup they can put out there um obviously they've signed a new number nine and we don't know what that's going to do to Bowen's output so that I guess I guess that's it it's like there's a little bit of disruption in that club with the incoming players they've signed which means that we don't necessarily know if he's going to translate what we saw in previous Seasons to returns this season but in terms of a proven player who could be a differential you know Villa and Palace first two okay fixtures I think they score in both games um but do they score more than one goal in those games it's debatable isn't it so that's that puts me off him I like to think that boen though will be a factor in our Seasons because we want that type of player to be in our thoughts because he's a good player kindly fairly kindly priced but at the moment he's playing second fiddle to e and golden in that range isn't he and now jotu as well so that's why he's being overlooked yeah I wouldn't go there to start with I think yeah I mean you could argue with with E's you know linking with with Man City and with Gordon's you know not quite secure of whether he's going to start but Bowen is actually quite a good option especially because it's against the Villa side without Louise and we're not quite sure how they're going to be I mean they weren't great defensive side last season anyway were they so it's not completely beyond the Realms of possibility that he's going to do quite well in in that game I don't hate it I'm not seeing him in many teams I don't know what his ownership is it's probably quite low is it about I'd guess 12% as a guess you reckon let's have a look live on the show let's have a look say 12% seven s% yeah I mean for me though how many goals do they score in those two games against Villa at home Palace away it's between two and three goals isn't it they're not scoring more than that I I know what you're saying about V they've got a n Low I I I I think I've tipped one all for this I don't think it' be a game of goals I think it'd be a Ki start and then going to Palace cellers Park under glasner they've lost players as well you know and they might have lost Gaye by then or he might not start because he's on his way out so there is potential that you know because we don't know what we're going to get from Villa and Palace defenses it could be that West Ham score three to four goals but personally I wouldn't back more than a couple over those two and is that enough for boen to return heavily he I think I expect him to get suming out the first two but it might just be an assist and if you look at jotter going to wit switch and then at home to brenford i' much rather have jotter simple as that isn't it yeah yeah I think J's so clear of of of Bowen at least at least initially but Bowen will be a factor for us a bit later on um but yeah I definitely go jotter in the in the short to medium term um go we're going back to questions asked like an hour ago yeah it's crazy uh this is from Albin again would to J Pedro and Allison to Munos would and Anderson or Pedro and Munos uh would we start Xiao Pedro's a long-term concern now with the signings that have come in or coming in um but would wood will be replaced in that Forest lineup within four to six weeks I would say aan is going to take time to get fit I would say it'll take him a month to get fit so I think wood will be if you're wild card in between three and four then then you can start with wood and then Wild Card away if you're looking to extend the Wild Card further and you think you're going to need to make sign swaps elsewhere in your team then you don't really want wood as another headache You' go munes because munes has great fixtures and I can't see him being a risk of rotation himz will will take some minutes of him r or whatever you want to call him um but I feel that well some people call him Ro some people call him himz don't they um soy yes sorry um so I think munes is is a standout in the Six Million bracket so I would go him but if you're wild card in in game ahead of game four Wood's a great option because of the first three fixtures and I think he will return a couple of goals in the first three yeah you I would go moon is if you're wild card in after game week four would if you're not yeah yeah no agree although it is Mos MOS oh no in the question was about MOS not oh yeah well that's would would yeah I think he mo I think he means to Fulham strike surely yeah I see because it wouldn't make any S no wood to J Pedro and Anders no Anderson to oh I see right so he there yeah he wants to downgrade wood to J Pedro so he can Moos to a play yeah yeah uh yeah I would is that is that going to be worth it is that going to be worth it I think again if you're wild card in game week four then I would keep with wood and Anderson if you're looking more longterm if you're looking to wild card after that it's the xia Pedro question isn't it it's like how much under threat is he G to be when those signings come in you've got to think it's going to take three to four weeks between routa is settled and threatening Jia Pedro's start and we might even see xia Pedro move to the nine and rout com in the 10 so if you're not going a wild card game ahead of game week four I would go xia Pedro Munos I think give it risk it because I think longterm moono is gonna return better than Anderson it's close isn't it but I don't I don't really understand why anyone's picking wood well short term three pictures you think he starts all three yeah yeah okay he will start I just think there's massive risk there surely without an ie well I wouldn't say it's massive I'd say you know I'd say after the break after the break the Aon will start I think but it's going to take him he's going to have sub appearances in the first couple of games and maybe wolves wolves um Wolves at home he might start that one but I don't see it I think wood will wood will start the first two and probably do enough which means he starts all three so you'll get those first three Plum fixtures before Forest go to Liverpool but you're going to need to get rid of him after the break because I think aan will come in at that point yeah Barry says wood is always the early riser yeah we had to go there Barry Barry had to go there didn't he I saw you made a chriswood joke on Twitter the other day I was thought I was beneath you what Harry's expense yeah I I kind of felt I was disappointed with myself and I noticed Harry didn't like it so I feel a shame now I saw it and screenshoted it sorry Harry sorry gone in the folder it's of course of course it has Gothic Band life bring back the charity Shield cast a charity yeah forget all this community Shield nonsense charity Shield is was the way and mil this and milk cup absolutely uh this is from deck thank you the Super Chat bayy Halland Smith row or porro Gibbs white and e or Winks I'm guessing win oh my God I'm guessing Wings wouldn't be a starter in this uh in this Bailey and M Smith or porro gives white and Winks or gives white and and Winks that's a tough one isn't it [Music] um yeah I really like porro I think bayy Halland Smith Road Edge for me I think so too because what you got there is three active players I think Bailey you're getting on early for the Villa fixtures Smith row is going to be a gift that keeps on giving and hul's very good game we W um I'd want porro though out of the other option i' find a way of getting po I don't think you need Gibbs w e and you certainly don't need winks and the issue with Winks is you know you're getting a one point twoo player there sling Harry wi I don't think you need to get a four five mid when you can get a really effective five million mid obviously it's not five and it makes a difference but can you not find that say the jump from Winks to Rogers is huge for me I think at the end of the season there's going to be what 50 points in that I would say and I know you don't you're not signing players now for the long term but Rogers could be Rogers could score gameweek one and be 5-2 by gameweek two and so I just think you find the extra five 0.5 and you go Winks to Rogers don't you so I wouldn't get Winks myself unless you really have to unless you're absolutely skin flin and and that unlocks something that you think is going to make your early game weeks am I am I crazy for thinking there isn't much between Smith row and the six FES there's not like I'd still I'd still be considering Smith row with fulham's fixtures even if he was 65 I agree and and you know if you look at review if you look at review they it says the same if you look if you look at the algorithm and you show show me the best six5 mid over the opening three four games Smith rose right up there I think he's even he was even top at one point so I do think because of the fixtures and and I think that's fair enough I think that Smith row we've seen and we know he's playing in the 10 we know he's going to be high up he's going to be in and around munz all the knockdowns and um Fulham I think will have to be in attacking team because I don't think defensively they're sound enough having lost Pina that might change they will make signings but I think they're going to concede goals and score goals and that's good if you're getting on Smith row I agree I think he's I would go him over a six5 at the moment because of the obviously the saving yeah it's one of the reasons why in the end I took I took um enku down to Smith row and actually having that that extra million let me go up to Gordon so you know I was able to get in Gordon I was able to bring in Rogers I did um eay to Gordon oh I Shan a bit I Shan a bit but yeah I was able to make some upgrades some pretty decent upgrades with that I love this comment from deck thank you men looking forward to watching all season we described as men menly men that's I'll take that as a compliment to be honest that yeah yeah yeah quite like that uh do you want to carry on with the cont should take some more Super chats uh let's take another one should we I don't know what we got left up as leave this is from uh we we've got quite a bit we've got goal scorers um and we've got predictions of course predictions yeah goal scor and predictions let's let's do the goal scores at half past and then let's do another eight minutes of these um G I'm contemplating salanki Smith and Millo I like all three of those options very much uh versus moon is inku and moon o which do you think are better oh I like them all I like all I literally like all of those picks very rare to get something like that a three on three and like them all but I do I let you I I think I yeah I mean I I mean over the first couple of game I like Spurs his first two games I think Spurs score four to five goals against Lester and Evan so I would say they're going to score four to five goalss over those two games um so salanki you got to think could return pretty handsomely early on you need to get on Fulham from game week two in some capacity I would say because Lester it switched West Ham Newcastle their run is so strong and and Forest have got a good first three so I would say the first option to lanki Smith R Millo just edges it for me um because I do think that Smith row is the stronger option over munz for him I think San's first two means that he'll return earlier and better than Inu and the palace defense I don't know how much we can rely on that and it's brenford West Ham Chelsea I think they could easily concede in all three of those games whereas I think Forest will get one clean sheet out of the first three so if you're going to game week three and wild card in four then the first option for me salanki Smith R Millo there you go I answered it where you going that yeah he did uh I agree I my my first thing I I look at with something like this is who's the be like you've got six different players there who is the best one and I think that quite clearly is salanki out of the six especially for the first two but he could he could the sky is the limit for what he could do in those first two games so do I think Smith row and Murillo is that much worse than kungu and Munos no because Forest have got really good games a good three they should keep at least one clean sheet in those and we've talked about Smith row I think he's amazing value and he has a great run so I think they're both all all six of those players should do well but I would back for the first three mostly because it's got sank in it yeah exactly I think getting on Spurs for the first two in some capacity I wouldn't say is essential but like I say I see four or five goals for Spurs against Leicester and Everton collectively I think they can go to leester win two or three nil and I think they can beat Everton by two goals at least so therefore you're looking at an output of four to five goals whereas you look at Chelsea and think right how many are they going to score against City and Wolves Away I think possibly two to three goals at most over those two games and sank is playing up front and then kungu is probably in one of the 10 roles and probably will get less minutes over the two games in sanki as well San could be on pens we don't know yet so it's strongly weighted in San's favor when when you're comparing the best two players there which are sanki and kunu in terms of price salanki wins it by some margin I think over the first three games over the season and kungu could outscore him and be a great option but we've got to think you're going to make transfers so get on get the points in early and I think that's the first Trio over the second yeah M my plan is Gordon game week one assess enu and then move if I need to after game week one yeah because I do think Inu could be unbelievable but I'd like to see it first yeah I mean my my concerns about it is we haven't yet seen Amara's systems bedding in have we I mean they've been pretty disastrous preseason they've scored some goals but they've let in some Horrors and what is the normal reaction to letting in goals and having defensive problems well it's not going on the attack and scoring loads of goals it's normally be more pragmatic be more solid and that doesn't lend itself to returns from kungu now I'm speculating but obviously if a manager sees loads of goals going in one end in preseason is he going to go gung-ho against Man City at home probably not yeah so what do we really expect from Chelsea in that first game I expect them to be trying to contain City and try and break on them are they going to score two or three goals I don't see it I've gone the other way I've gone for them I think it might take a couple of weeks for them to settle down and realize they can't just be gungho as moresa kind of learns learns the league we must have Chelsea fans in the chat Robert ducky was in earlier see if Rober is still around see what he thinks but I I think we need to sit tight on Chelsea until we've seen moresa and how his system settles in and like I say the byproduct of letting goals in preseason could be a more cautious approach to the start yeah we'll see yeah FBI pro has gifted a blackbox membership thank you very much very generous for you it's always funny is it I think it goes to the next commentator the the gifting of the yeah right yeah that's fun yeah so be on the lookout for those not sure who got that but I think um focal was in the chat earlier and he said he got one he doesn't need any gifts he's fine I know he joined our he joined the patreon not The Paton he joined the um uh no I thought he already had a m he must have canceled it anyway but yeah thank you Oscar appreciate it uh Mark cram son or sacka good question for you Mark and best 4.5 million keeper rotation I haven't looked at I haven't looked at four or five Keepers because I've settled on my Keepers so if you go and get a view on that um son or sacka um I would say I I think sacka is a better option I do like son over the first two but if you're going to choose one and you're not wild card in in gameweek four then I would go sacka over son yeah I just think he's definitely got the pens obviously we don't know if son will retain them son will be out wide probably all season sacka is out wide but we know his output out there is is reliable Home and Away against top six bottom top eight bottom six we saw that last week in in the episode we did last week um son's career is I hesitate to say on a downward trajectory because I don't think it is necessarily but obviously sacka is on the rise still who would you say is still improving as a player you would go natural a natural Downy yeah yeah natural one because you where he is in his career whereas saca's probably still on the up and and probably has his best season to come does son have his best Premier League season to come probably not he's probably had it so I don't mean had it literally but um because I love son but I think sacka edges it for me where are you going with the best four five keeper rotation and one other yeah I like the Henderson and mich ipswitch goalkeeper that would give you brenford away West Ham at home Fulham at home leester at home Southampton away and Everton away it's pretty good is it if you looked at fleen I mean fen's very popular as well isn't he so you look atation well they've got they've got three good home games in the first six and then three awful away games so fleen and Henderson's pretty good as well that would get you that would get you Palace um West Ham Southampton Leicester man united West Ham yeah that is good West Ham walls Forest it Swit walls so for me it's fle and Henderson isn't it if you're going too for that's what it looks like to me um and we know Henderson's number one there's not any doubt with that because Johnson's probably out his way out of the club um flecken stars so you're getting save points there I don't know about a 4 five rotation I've not looked at it as an option I mean the danger with that and I have done it before is you're getting it wrong each week and it's very frustrating so you need a rotation where you're absolutely sold on the preferred option um and there's no Dilemma to it but would you consider it have you looked at it at all over the summer potential have you always four five I'm never doing it again honestly that that year when I had well I started off with Warden ion and that was disaster and then I ended up with Ward and Henderson and I got it wrong literally every single week I I just they're so hard to predict when you're going to get a goalkeeper Hall and even with good fixtures if you're picking players from like brenford and Palace even like a good home fixture doesn't always translate into points it's different if you've got like a ryer or or someone because you know they're much more likely to get one but like brenford aren't good at keeping clean sheets I Palace are I just think if you if you're going to if you're going to spend four five on a goalkeeper just spend four five on a goalkeeper don't add another one into the mix yeah and then you play them week we out yeah I've never got it right before I'd rather have Pope for example and a four million than try and get the the rotation right yeah or Leno or something like that yeah till you pay the all five but or pick because we know he's gonna be gonna be there if you're doing it Fleck and Henderson's the way to go yep okay well I still like me Rich but it's fine we can disagree uh let's take a look at this is brilliant stuff from Rob tfpl so he's we got a couple of screens uh from this so this is his uh team top projected scorers so this is top three projected season long scores for each team hopefully people can see or at least start to try and make this out on if if it's a little bit blurry but I mean a lot of this is is pretty pretty obvious right sacka pavs no guard 70 goals predicted for sacka 14 for hav odard Watkins Bailey Rogers that's all fine it's all good then we get to teams like Leicester so they're predicting madidi and vardy at 73 and then it's the man that you keep slating every stream Mr Harry Winks yeah but just draw your attention Mr Harry Winks is getting 1.8 goals Rogers for not five more seven goals and we haven't even talked about assists yet right so look at that Gap how big is that Gap it's easily 5050 points are you not finding not five for 50 point gap of course you are and Rogers could do more than that you just don't know I mean my point wasn't to slate Harry Winks again my point was yeah but I still turned it I still turned it around to slating Harry Winks sorry she did it's very very impressive but yeah I think Leicester like vardy vard's not gonna get seven goals this season is he I'd be very surprised M could could get seven to 10 something like that but the fact they got anyone else yeah bookies are looking at the options right so they're looking at they're giving they're giving Lester a total goals tally and they're looking at the options it's the same way the models work they use bookies odds to do this and so when a team has got very few goal scoring options you're going to see the goals split amongst the options they have got right sensibly um madidi on pens as well right so they're presuming that he's going to share them with vardy vardy I don't know no one's going anywhere near leicesters are taking options are they nowhere near I just looked at these and I saw I saw Leicester with with those three Southampton with Armstrong and Diaz like at least I don't know I would back both of those to get eight to 10 goals um which isn't too bad ipwi look mean look at ipswitch chaplain deap and Hutchinson like six or seven goals each and that's probably yeah scenario they tend to spread the goals out don't know they don't have a central Striker who scores a lot of goals for under under McKenna but um yeah again you're not looking there I mean Armstrong for Sav Anon what was what was his predicted output you know not double figures I think he'll get double figures I think he will I mean yeah I mean Rogers is a standout for me again five million and he's predicted seven goals to Bailey's 7.5 yes Bailey will get more assists but there's there's not there's 1.5 million in that and yet The Bookies here are saying that Rogers is going to get almost the same number of gold returns as biley again it underlines the value that he offers um seeno 7 point he's 55 as well C's 55 7.8 so there's it does highlight a few Bargains in that bracket again here doesn't it yeah um Smith row is there at six just under Moonis and and ra so again 5.5 million asset is is is doing well so yeah should say this is before Bournemouth signed the new Striker today I think that that deal is going through so so about 40 40 million something haven't million euros yeah yeah fair enough gamble Yep this is the kind of the same sh projected goals and shareed team goals for game week one so when looking at our captains esack is top of this 60% chance he scores at least one goal and a 20% chance he scores two harand just shy of that 55% chance of a goal 20% chance of of two and then it's all the kind of likely assets Salas Saka havt I don't know what Darwin's doing in there but don't go there uh son and then jayus gakpo jotter but yeah what I mean isach and and Isaak Carland and Salah just probably are the best Captain you could also add sacka onto that as well so it's the top four really that that people are looking for so it kind of bears out in that have you wavered on esack at all no I mean I mean we haven't got data to look at tonight we haven't really had a debate about the captaincy I think it's it's really isak orella sacker I don't think Harland really enters the equation despite what this data shows I think in terms of fbl the strongest options are isach Salah and sacka in that order then probably harand comes out after that you you wouldn't be surprised for harand to return but the other three are probably more for me are more likely to get a double return either a goal and assist two goals whatever isak we saw in the last episode our strong ear as some James's Park our strong years against bottom six Ides that was only last season's data we haven't got more than that to go on necessarily but i' still back him to get at least one return um and of the players listed there at the top he's probably the most likely to get two returns I would say yeah yeah um so I don't think I don't think there's too much debate on the captaincy there I think salah's obviously a fine option is which no question sacka could easily get a return in a win for Arsenal against wolves but he act for me is is somewhat ahead just as The Bookies say here I guess The Bookies are presuming 90 minutes here as well or presume in a start which is why Darwin's up there right which is is not going to happen because I think he's going to be certainly gonna be on the bench at best the the share on the right sort of a comment about it represents the the likelihood they're involved in How likely they how the percentage of goals they're likely to be involved in essentially um so that drops sacka down for example 22% because there's so many other players that that could um could assist or or or score in that game and it's Harland with 40% so harland's got the highest predicted share of goal involvement within the team so if you think City are going to score four or five past Chelsea which is beyond the Realms of possibility even with their depleted Squad you'd expect him to to have the most involvement but he it's not goal involvement though it's it's yeah well it is goal as in score is goals yeah it's not it's not factoring an assists here which is where I think obviously Salah and saaka will overtake Harland in terms of pure likelihood of involvement in goals or assists I would say yeah I think Salah and saaka probably beat Harland this week um and yeah they're saying harland's most likely to get two goals more than isak I don't really agree with that I no they are saying isak's favorite to get two plus yeah 21% yeah that's how I see it but it's share I guess I think that's what you're saying yeah I mean we've with so many players out for City it's a struggle to see who else can score goals in the first game for for them I mean Rodrigo could turn out one it could be someone unexpected ACC course Rodrigo often does against tough teams if starts yeah but he's unlikely to start and de Bry is unlikely to start foden unlikely to start there sources of goals are are kind of dried up aren't they there dku could start and get something greish I guess but neither of them two are what you would describe prolific for Midfield so far so I'm not surprised to see that share predicted Y and then the final one of these is over the season so projected goal involvements again through the spreading markets um Harland at the top of this 33.5 Salah very high on this at 28. five I mean not super surprising given the seasons he's had but again you talk about players on a natural downward trory you got to think it's going to start happening for Salah at some point uh sacka is at 27.5 Palmer at 25.5 and son just under that at 25 and fod in the bottom those kind of mid pric midfielders 24.3 isack 20.9 he's quite someway down from from kind of the others um and a bit down from Watkins as well I'm surprised he's not higher actually yeah I mean I plan to move isak out to Watkins early on to get on the Villa run so I'm not getting isak in game week one as a player I'm necessarily goingon to hold on to obviously that might change um you depends on how how long Watkins takes to get up to speed how Villa start how Newcastle start maybe but I think a sensible move is eak initially and then move him off to Watkins for game week three yeah um for the extra KN five so I'm keeping not five reserved to do that because the Villa fixures are so strong and like The Bookies I do think Watkins is a stronger player in terms of output obviously I think you got 18 assists last season right he will not repeat that but he is more likely to assist than than isach doesn't have the pens we don't know but unlikely to have the pens we think walk in so that's in isak's favor and Villa do have European football champions league football which could disrupt them and we don't know yet what that's going to do to them but we can predict like it did to Newcastle that it will result in a downturn in their Fortunes in the Premier League does it mean fewer goals maybe so there is yeah there's unknown to Villa but I do do think those fixures are so good from gameweek three onwards you've got to get on you've got to get on one of their attack and obviously Watkins is a go to I mean what I take for this is the value that eay can provide I mean he's high up there of 18.3 but with the uncertainty about where his future Li potentially that's the that's the outli there because if he goes to City that's dropping through the floor yep yep no agree with that should look at some predictions yeah the new predictions for black box I mean you've got some people to thank for this we do yeah we um there's a good comment here which is tonight's stream sponsor should be sponsored by spec Savers which I which I like um the sponsor for blackbox this week is actually sleeper who we mentioned last week and the reason why we like sleeper so much is because they're a perfect partner for the predictions that we're going to be talking about uh in a bit so there's a QR code on the screen there's 2,700 people watching I would love you all to give it a scan you can take a screenshot if you're on like an iPhone and then you can get the get the link through there or if you're watching this on TV or whatever just just grab it with your phone um that will get you into the pickham blackbox league where there's 8,000 worth of prizes to win it's completely free to play No gambling no crypto anything like that all you've got to do each week is predict the outcome of 10 games and the person who predicts the most every month will win like an Xbox a play PlayStation a steam deck an iPhone an iPads you can literally choose whatever you want up to the value of £500 a month and then the overall winners first second and third are going to win vouchers worth 1500 ,500 is there any reason not to get involved Mark I I can't think of a reason other than the blurriness means the QR code doesn't work but it does work I've just checked it no I um no we were we were staggered weren't we when we spoke to sleeper and the generosity you know how they're supporting the the FBO world because you you'll notice a lot of the FBO content creators have have got on board with sleeper and and why not because they're they're a new player into the UK fantasy market and they're and they're here to make a big big noise about it and talking to them they're just they just just a breath of fresh a when it comes to Partners they understand what we do they understand the fbl and they're being very generous with the prizes that they're able to give out which is obviously great for us building our our own following and community so yeah I mean even if you don't follow them via US do follow them via one of the other content creators that you know doubt watch um because I think they deserve some attention for your attention for the amount of Love they've shown the fbl community Through the content creators so far over the summer so hats off to to S sleeper absolutely well said and and what they're looking to is just build an app which integrate scores news there's a draft game there's a fantasy game you know they've got I was talking to one of the heads earlier I say this on Scout on on the Kuno with Sam and you know like when you can watch obviously the 3:00 games you can't watch the whole match but you can sort of see the heat map and the action of where things are happening and where the ball is live they've got that built into the app but with like a chat room as well so you can actually talk to people following the match similarly and you know you can see how that affects your fo teams I don't know I think it's I think it's really GNA take off and they've absolutely smashed the US market coming over to the UK bringing in all these great things and yeah just just give them a try see what you think of it it's a slick app and you'll be supporting black box as well by sponsoring Fest as well tomorrow so they'll be they'll be they'll be sponsoring Fest so which is great they supported that as well and hopefully they stick around in the community and and long may they be a supporter of of Us and other content creators really good absolutely right let's look at the predictions yes let's come over to our own predictions and you can also get involved in in these as well as as sleeper uh FPL blackbox Godfather tier patrons will be able to compete against Mark and I uh in the predictions that we do each week there will be a trophy for the winner of this the only caveat is You' got to make 200 predictions or more over the season so if you want to get involved in this join uh the patreon start doing your predictions straight away and I've got to give just such a massive shout out uh to to Lee and Liv who have built a website for us where we can track all these predictions um and it's going to make our lives easier because we haven't got to send each other files with all the all the scores in and and stuff automatically comes through so massive shout out to them they've worked so hard over preseason and it's a really cool perk of the of The Godfather tier league so check out if you're interested the trophy is amazing I'll get some photos of that as well uh and obviously you can play pick him alongside that the QR codes on the screen for this uh too but yeah in terms of predictions if switch Liverpool first game you've gone for three- nil Liverpool I've gone for 41 yeah I I was unsure whether it's which will score and I because I've got two Liverpool to defenders in my lineup I've obviously gone with a clean sheet can't predict a non Liverpool clean sheet and then pick two of their Defenders so yeah I mean I yeah I've seen Liverpool start the season well Salah always scores game week one of course I think he scored what for six consecutives or five consecutive Seasons now on gameweek one always returns so you've got it's I want it switch to stay up I really do because I love McKenna I love their his approach to football I think they are going to surpris a few but I don't think they're going to surprise us on the opening game week I think Liverpool are going to have far too much for them have a lot of the ball a lot of possession a lot of passing and unfortunately probably three goals or more and yeah that's it for me three nil you're going for one I think they Nick one just given it's the first home game this season there might be a bit of rust in Liverpool and you know they're going to be really up for it but I think it's going to be a a route either way uh Arsenal wolves I've gone for 3-0 Arsenal you've gone for for a 2-nil I expect this to be pretty routine for Arsenal they've looked strong preseason sacker back wolves have lost their best player can't see anything more than more than a a big Arsenal win yeah disruption in the Wolves defense I guess makes you wonder what they're you know how Resolute they're going to be here I would expect them to well will it be a l it'll be a fairly low block and counter is what they'll go for plenty of pace on the break although obviously no now so that threat's gone and that's their major threat so a lot of upheaval for wolves and probably you've got to say Rodrigo Gomez looks very Lively and that looks like a positive acquisition but apart from that they've probably taken a step back in terms of squad depth and quality so unfortunately I think they're going to be a team that struggles and if you're listing candidates of the bottom six wolves have probably got to be in those candidates uh one of about eight or nine teams I would say opening day Arsenal and they beat Forest last season 2-1 they got ahead 2-0 then let one in they they were a little bit Rusty so I've gone 2N rather than bigger than that yep yeah been yeah big big start uh for them especially the left back spot who starts for them for Arsenal would be a big one both G for the same score the next one Everton Brighton both gone for a 2-1 a 2-1 to Brighton with all of our attacking assets I think um Coleman's out isn't he which means it's going to be young oh right back yeah that's a isn't it think Young against matoma It's Kind have nightmares about that surely after is matoma gonna play out on the left is that is that they're thinking yeah yeah yeah well I mean Ashley Young needed V to keep Hudson AO out didn't he so I don't know how he's going to handle matomo he's a similar player isn't he very very tricky can go inside and out GNA wreck him yeah he's G absolutely wreck him ever will score in that game I'm sure they will but because they'll just knock a long ball over the top to calv Le and probably get off the mark in this but we should have a bit too much yeah I think man manchest uned Fulham the Fest game both gone for 2-1 Manu yeah I think that Fulham will put a good account of themselves up I think they score there'll be chances United let you will give you chances but equally F them without Palina you their back four is not settled they're after Diego Carlos so they need a center back he's no one's going to be an in time for Friday nights game obviously I think they're goingon to end up playing lukic and Reed maybe as the holding mids which I I worry that Bruno could profit from that because obviously he's in that pocket and um lukic is not a bad player but he's certainly not poino is he and that's a big loss so I do think United win but um I think a decent game for Friday night I think Fulmer really give it a go and you know the majority will be cheering for Fulham goals probably because some will have munes and some will have Smith row we'll see how Brunos there are I might be a Bruno owner I only only a few hours I might be oh my god there would definitely be some Bruno and gach show owners probably not too many Defenders on show but a few of those uh West Ham Villa I'm going to this game I'm going to this game with Andy North did you know that yeah I know I wasn't going to tell you this but you were second choice because I couldn't go because I'm going to the Forest game no way he asked you first I wanted to tell you that live on a just to break your heart yeah I'm joking no no I'm not joking I mean I yeah yeah because basically it's so anymore it's a so rare thing you don't even play so rare yet so basically yeah of course devastated you when when Ralph's heart breaks when uh when he when he the lease has a go him yeah well don't worry Andy will make it up to you by giving you one of his passwords so don't worry about it think his National Insurance number and his his pin number then we'll we'll wake it up yeah to be to be fair this is so rare I've got no interest in so rare at the moment oh you should have it's very good but I'm not going to advertise them because they're not paying me yet yeah it is a really good game um and um but yeah I don't want to bore people with that here but yeah love it you're enjoying it uh brenford Palace 22 I've gone for 1-1 both we've gone quite similar with these with these scores both gone for drawing this one yeah I it's one of those games that's very difficult to call isn't it and um they're two teams that we're not going to they're two teams that we're not going to rush to invest in I don't think e would have been the player here to have but I was never sure about e going to brenford one thing that does make me tempted though is that I know preseason brenford have really struggled with set plays defending set plays um so e will be on a lot of those if not all of them without Alis there so and we expect to start I was only jesting early I was only speculating that he could be on the move and therefore miss out I don't that's not that's not very likely e will start and probably be palace's key man as we expect but the thing is that we've said this before haven't we when when teens only have to worry about e and shut him down they can put men on him when Elis was in the team that gives them a couple of You Know Jack in the boxes to think about it's harder to contain both of them whereas brenford will look at e and you went to didn't you go this fixture last season I was gonna say I went I went to this exact fixture last season at brenford and Palace um and E ran the show he was he was unbelievable I I can't remember what he might have got an assist um might might have scored I think he got something in that game but he was Anderson scored didn't he from the back for that's right yeah well remember yeah he was he was excellent though it was it was one of those moments when you go and see a team and there's just one player who is just head and shoulders above everyone else on the pitch and that was a I remember the because I was first choice to go but I couldn't go so I think you got the ticket after me very good wouldn't surprise me if if y was asking you to was I had no idea sorry yeah yeah yeah she looking forward to seeing you next week with the um the match of the day challenge oh hitching in the kitchen it's gonna be so Gooding in the kitchen yeah nice C bass for Billy he's coming he is coming coming he is yeah yeah he can't wait yeah good uh Chelsea Man City I was very surprised with your score for this one I've gone for 3-2 Man City I think there's goals all over this you g for two nil C won't keep a clean sheet in this surely I I think my view is that Chelsea will look to contain them they'll break on them and do a job and yeah I just I think yeah I think you know it's good the The Possession game is going to be very interesting because obviously moresa is going to be heavy on that but he's up against the manager and the team who who prioritizes that over everything um it is interest because the players missing the players missing for city is difficult to know we said earlier like other than Harlem where's the goal fret going to come from obviously they've got quality players but you know looking at data in terms of goal output the 11 they have on the pitch there probably isn't going to be a player who's going to hit double figures next SE this season on that pitch because a lot of those players who could aren't going to be aren't going to be playing unless they get more from greish and doku this season which they might I I just think it's difficult to call but I just don't think I think Chelsea are going to be way off to begin with I just don't think there's going to be fluidity to to their play there's going to be gaps at the back it's what we've seen preseason he won't have fixed that overnight mesa's system takes time to learn and he hasn't had his primary players like Palmer in that system yet so I just don't think they're fully cook yet so City win for me I think it's G to be I be chaos be chaos players missing is going to like MCAT playing up front for Man City with Harland and no rodri and Chelsea going to play about who hell is gonna start I don't know it's just should be an interesting one um yeah I think I I think Chelsea definitely scored but I think City win uh Leicester Spurs I've gone for a 41 Spurs again just that goal because Leicester first home game mad penalty I reckon in the 20th minute or something and then Spurs just going absolutely absolutely thrash them you've gone for a 3-0 Spurs nice and routine for the way side yeah I I you know I think Cooper will try and contain them and there will be a low block but I just don't see Leicester having enough to keep them out and um Spurs at home is not a game you want as the first first game for leester I feel sorry for Cooper and Leicester because if it was an away game he can go and do a low block and he'll be under no pressure to get result because it's a home game first game in charge of Leicester in front of the the home crowd he doesn't want to send his team out and go right just camp on the edge of the box and try and keep them out but unfortunately I think that's what they'll they'll have to do and it definitely is in Cooper's Mo to do that and he's done it successfully I remember the Arsenal game we won one nil to stay up we were so deep we were in we were all we had about 10 men in the penalty area we you know it was crazy we kept one outside and that was it and we kept Arsenal out but by then we were a team World drilled that Cooper knew inside out he doesn't know that Leicester team well enough to get a low block out of them could be effective against the Spurs I don't think so they'll have far too much for them I think you would you would definitely think so and and like I keep say you think leester is so short so short this going into this season yeah uh you know we've got one outcome different I know I noticed that so we've got a new prediction system but same old same old in terms of outcomes but yeah maybe it's an easy week to call though who knows uh Forest Bournemouth both come for a forest win you're going to this one confident uh I am confident actually yeah mainly because obviously we're playing bourou without sanky and then the following week after next it'll be Wolves of Netto we've we've definitely got lucky with the fixtures and we've got lucky with obviously the transfer moves um bouth will probably have some menu up front I think Sinister and cver could be threats but I think we've got enough to contain them I think we're we're fairly decent in wide areas milanovic or Millo will take care of Seena I think um and our threats will come from wide with a Langer and Hudson ad do and towards the end of the season Hudson Ado was was almost Unstoppable and he's looked sharp and we got Gibbs white as a creative Force down the middle I think we'll win the Midfield battle I think they're likely to um yeah I me it's not they look light there but I think sar's in for a big season and he's look really good preseason and hoping that he can be a dominant force in there um so I think with the home crowd that's a massive Factor as well we'll be loud we'll be super loud um and we've put some extra seats in the corner looks like we put a load of deck chairs up it looks really bad it's being described as the Gary Mixon stand which will tell you what what level of quality we've got um so we'll have even more voices yeah exactly but um yeah I I'll go two one I think we concede but we'll win and then the final game is Newcastle Seth Hampton both gone for big wins for the home sides I've gone for a 5-nil you've gone for a 4-0 I think this is other than City away this is the worst possible game you could have because the James's Park crowd are going to be going absolutely nuts uh I know Gordon's a bit of a doubt I know chpp is a bit of a doubt but this is you're playing against such a good attacking side and esack would just scare the life out of me if I was a Southampton Defender he's just gonna he's going to cause Carnage I think well Forest went to Newcastle for their first game back in the Premier League two yeah two seasons ago and we went there with a kind of level of squad that Sav Hampton have got As in largely a championship Squad with not too much top level quality they've got some decent players that could help them survive but like you said the last fixture you want I mean other than other than Liverpool way or Man City away the next in line is probably St James's park because at home they're incredibly strong the atmosphere there will be very partisan santon fans will have a party but I think there Forest lost 51 that day I believe so 51 was it I think yeah there was there was at least five I think at least four goals in it I've wiped it for my memory because obviously it was a shocking start and I I do think unfortunately that Newcastle will probably hand a similar beating out to Southampton um yeah fans just like the forest PS on the day will have a party because they're back in the Premier League and that Summit to celebrate and they will get far far easier days than they're going to get on Saturday yeah um if it is Saturday um but yeah so there's nothing to worry about from this first game because not many teams will go to St James's Park and get a result so um but unfortunately defensively I think there's question mark I mean Russell Martin will come up and try and push style and their style is to play out from the back lots and lots of passes and Newcastle one of the best pressing sides in the Premier League and they'll press high and I just don't think s Hampton have the quality to play through them so unless Russell Martin is going to surprise us and turn up with a bit more direct a bit less risk taking they're gonna get freshed yeah yep completely agree um that's it for the predictions then uh thank you everyone for if you've joined the sleeper league if you're joining as a patreon and you want to get involved in the predictions League as mentioned uh do that it's a fun way to get involved in all these fest tomorrow Mr Southerns I will see I'm nervous oh I'm so nervous because I mean I remember last year we had the the Gabrielle celba thing didn't we we had the Gabrielle C last minute and we had no internet connection so we couldn't make the change and then I don't want to be tinkering with my team I remember the morning of Fest I put Salah in and um didn't regret it because he started the season well not many people went a lot of people went you know Harland with Bruno and spread the funds in Midfield and I went I think I went two Heavy Hitters and it worked out well I don't know yet I'm sitting here now and I don't know where I'm going to go as we're going to look at our teams in a minute and I think that I think I'm still going to be undecided tomorrow because I'm I'm going to be doing prep for Fest after this putting the Pod out I don't know when I'm going to go to bed and the were you don't want to be making transfers you know two or three in the morning do we so I'm not going to have my team ready for tomorrow but yeah it's going to be lovely to see everybody but that's the other thing I'm going to be saying hello to lots of people meeting lots of people it's it's always lovely so I don't want to go and be thinking about oh should I do this or should I do that still so plus there's the drink fourth fourth from bottom could you just uh sorry third from bottom you read that one to me listen to top advice is that yeah you can't even work out youed yeah I know I mean we are going to be you know revealing our teams live at the at the uh at the Fest and um the teams we're going to show now I would say are unlikely to be my final team I would say I'm sure there's going to be a change before Fest well I'm I'm there I think with mine is that you locked this is I would never use the lock Emoji never use it in this way but I think this I don't think I'm going to make any changes it's Henderson in goal with Trent porro and Barco sacka J Gordon Rogers Harland esack and sanki and then Bentley Smith row Robinson and Johnson so the week links herea Barco and potentially Rogers if they can get an attacking return between them I'll be happy next week Smith R and Robinson come in for Fulham great run I don't think there's any real weakness here he says confidently um obviously there's massive worries about Salah going off on one I haven't got vardal who I want I haven't got any Arsenal Defenders but you can't have them all and this is what my tinkering has led me to so the the the moves I made today I did three transfers earlier I did Winks en kungu and who was the other one e winks and kungu and E out for Gordon Rogers and Smith row so talk me through the strategy with J then do you expect to have him going into gameweek through or is he going to go early what are you thinking hard to say isn't it I'd like to keep him if he does well in the first couple of weeks he'll obviously stay but there's players I can move to I mentioned potentially doing Gordon down to enku that could be jotter if he loses his place down see what happens with e if I can get through the get through August and he's still at Palace and they've got good fixtures coming then he's someone that can come back in that 75 bracket is is somewhere that I can I can move around to but ideally I'd like to keep a Liverpool player a Liverpool attacker going forward because I think they're they're going to be good I mean he could even move to Diaz if if Darwin starts playing up front and Diaz is looking good then that could just be a sideways move over over to him or the whole thing could get ripped up and I could end up getting Salah anyway and taking har doubt so yeah I mean I want I wanted J and I was all in for jotter um but then when the Oscar Bob injury came I'm looking I'm probably going to overlook him I mean I knew when I was getting him that come game week three there'll be anxiety about whether he starts because obviously Nunes and GPO will be a factor and we don't yet know from slot where he stands josa could easily do enough where he keeps his place but [Music] then the the the chance of injury and obviously European football kicks off after game week four as well and then that all bets are off then and when we talked about the champions league and the impact on teams there's no question if you're going in with jotter and the Champions League kicks in you're going to start to worry then even if he's had starts right because I can't see a world where there's not rotation once Liverpool kick into Champions League um yeah I I I don't mind your team but I think you when you go in with joty you got to have a strategy who are you going to move to moving to anduku makes sense um but it's then well if Barco loses his place as well that gives you another dilemma so yeah and and you've got to play Robinson every week presumably once you once you get P I think that's kind of key to to everything because he's got Leicester IP switch West Ham Newcastle Forest yeah that's five weeks where I will I will happily play him in all five of those games and if he had like a bad one and I was looking at a rotation I wouldn't be able to do this because I've got Barco and Johnson on the bench but I'm there's no way I'm gonna be benching Robinson the only one of those is Newcastle at home potentially but maybe um barco is even a factor you know at that point and it's and it's not a huge problem because that's when Brighton's good start happens I think it's forest in game week five when when Robinson has Newcastle um so if barco is still lining up a left back then it's good picture for him yeah you've got youve got it switch four and Forest five so you're playing Barco in those two probably it's just whether has Barco held on at that point yeah yeah yeah yeah I mean Robinson you're right I mean the re the thing with Robinson he's going to be high so even if um they concede goals he's going to be really up there and linking with Smith row and munes we've seen it preseason he's I think he's set up a couple of goals already preseason so we expect six seven eight assists over the season from him so even in bad fixtures he's going to be up there with the lead and assists from in that four five bracket for sure so I like him I like him a lot I've had him in an out of my team and I might still have him tomorrow as well so yeah I get it I just yeah and I don't think you've given yourself too many problems because I think Rogers will hold his start so that's okay if it was Bob there then you might have too many concerns because then got J Bob and Barco but in a way Bob's injury bringing Rogers in I think Rogers a bit more nailed less explosive low a ceiling but I think he's more nailed for sure yeah yeah don't mind it yeah what's chances this your team chances of this being your team at 6:30 tomorrow 95% wow blim me unless unless we get unless we get something from the press conferences that makes me you know cast out on any of these players it will it will be this team um and I'm determined not to make last minute changes because that's one of the preseason lessons that I always do um and yeah I think you know e it's sad to be losing e and then kungu because I I do back them both but I think Gordon and and Smith row should do should do well Gordon this week and then Smith R going forwards um anyway nothing about my team let's take a look yours has changed this is the first one where we you've changed your team massively again but I haven't followed suit and this is no Harland yeah I mean there's two reasons um match of the day challenge I don't want our teams are two identical weren't they when when not we had eight or nine players the same and I you know I don't mind that and I the thing is I'm past a point now where I really have to think about being optimal and trying to play for a top 10 KT Rank and stuff like that I do think about our teams being different and th having talken points and content and so on if there was a massive gap between the Harland lineups and Salah lineups I would go for the the one that it favors which you know at the moment there isn't though you you look at you look at projected points expected value on rate my team or on on r view and and the difference between the Salah builds and the Harlem builds is is small the Salah builds obviously give you more Manu room to maneuver funds around gives you a bit more coverage You could argue and when Bob got his injury it did change it for me it made me think well may that disrupt that disruption for Pep maybe means that their perhaps aren't as free flowing we're expecting them to fres it switch but you know it depends who is on the pitch and I built this team with the idea that I can move Son down to foden if I feel that foden starts that game against its witch I can get on City by moving sun down um so I've got I've got that option which is why son's there I could go Bruno and keep the money in the bank but out of Bruno and son for the opening game week I favor son I do think that Spurs will score more goals against Leicester than United will against Leicester uh Fulham and son is I think more likely to be involved than than Bruno in the in the game week one point so that's that's the reasoning there I fully expect to have to move to get foden in order to get me someone in that City it switch game and now I fully expect foden to start that with Bob out I think he's going to need goals on the pitch as soon as possible and so foden for me is someone I'm eying up for game week two I might not do it and if I don't you know then Spurs Spurs play Everton at home it's no harm in keeping some um so to go for the team for the podcast it's rying go porro koner Trent and Lewis Hall and the other Defender I've got is Barco at the moment and Son Salas Saka Rogers and Smith row isak salanki and munz so I'm going heavy on Spurs for the Leicester game because I expect it to be goals I'm going heavy on Fulham for their run from game week two um Newcastle at home to samton I've got eak and Hall Liverpool itwi I've got three players so I'm backing the teams with easy easier gameweek one fixtures or gameweek two fixtures and I think that's a sound strategy I haven't yet found a team that I like more than this but I think there's a lightly that I will before the Fest deadline so I think it could change but again obviously no Harland is the weakness I see that Raptors going no harand and he got a lot of negative comments about it but like I say I you know the review is saying Salah builds are fine and actually outscoring Harem builds at the moment that could change in hour to hour there's so little in it there really is and I think it would be great to be sitting with you on the couch in Hitching with me not owning Harland and you holding Harland right I no you won't be on the couch you'll be up here you'll be uncomfortable next to me you're gonna put me in the stress position yeah haven't got the luxury that you had sitting on that nice bean bag watching the TV yeah we're watching the monitor in here sorry but what do you think where's the weakness here um I guess playing four at the back when we've predicted so many goals worries me a little bit because I mean it's son and Salah for you versus is Harland and J for me which I think is quite close but then I've got Gordon and you've got Hall and I think Gordon is clearly the better option out of the two so that would War me a little bit but then you've got you've got Ry in gold and I've got Henderson so maybe that kind of balances it out but I think Solen Salah for this week against harand and jotter is close right that is jotter and Salah is about even and Leicester arguably the weakest team going into the league so there's not much in it between them so get away it this week but then game week two obviously watching it switch without Harland is is gon to be a tough watch for yeah so I've got I've got n five in the bank here so the idea is that gives me the option of going son to foden in game week two and then I can go eak to Watkins after that as well um if I go son down to foden I don't need to keep the not five in the bank but I just wonder whether it's worthwhile so I'm going to look at whether I can spend that n five and strengthen a bit more um I look at my back four yeah you're right back four is maybe a strange formation to go in but Spurs playing Leicester Liverpool it witch s Newcastle playing he not tempted to play to play mun or Smith row though player at Fest play one of them over coner I think you play them over who over over H over over coner over coner yeah con's gonna get six points maximum yeah possibly ma but I think a c she is Moon is I think I think I looked at the clean sheet odds and Liverpool are second favorites behind Arsenal aren't they and Spurs are third or fourth um so I'm the promoted sides would have to score for this to go very wrong which they could and wolves would have to score at Arsenal which they could but I think I've got the most likely sources of clean sheets there in Spurs Liverpool Newcastle Arsenal but I am relying on son getting something at Leicester but I think he will I think he will and salanki of course so I think there's returns there question for you son gets a brace against Leicester you're over the moon do you still sell him for foden it depends how certain I am on foden's start you know whether whether I'm absolutely sure foden's on that pitch I think in terms of home games last season foden outscored Harland in terms of total points he outscored Harland wouldn't be averse to captaining foden for the eight switch game if I'm certain he's on the pitch um so yeah it would depend a lot on that I mean obviously son against Everton yeah could be a good fixture for him which is why it's nice to have that option if I went Bruno I'd have Bruno at Brighton is that as good I mean arguably the opening day fixture son at Leicester Bruno at full at home to Fulham I would say son's got the better fixture and he's certainly got the better fixture game week two isn't he so if I do end up holding that player then I think I'd rather have son at home to Le to Everton gameweek two yeah um so that's why I'm favoring son I think at the moment and he's a big differential he's he's you know he's the biggest potentially not many people at all I mean have to have triple Spurs against Leicester and then potentially against Everton at home don't hate it's not bad I don't hate all no yeah I just didn't think s would end up anywhere near my team I thought did I but I can't go Brennan now because I don't know for sure that he gets the starts and his minutes are AR the under threet son will probably be on the pitch when the whistle blows won't he so yeah yeah that's it is a factor there's no question mixed opinions of your team Mark in the the okay uh I say mix most hate it okay why why because there no Highland I guess yeah good good respect for dedication talking about you know creating content and things like that and openness about you know about doing it other people just Andy T just that team is horrible not very constructive is it but I mean I mean any I don't if you if you're building a Salah team what else do you do with that really I mean I mean you can go Gordon in there if you're backing him to get stronger returns than son of course um I don't know I don't think it's horrible as Salah builds go but some people just look at non- harand teams and go that's horrible straight away don't they because like it and I get it I like it I think you know doing something bit different son's obviously the the wow factor you bring in Smith row and munes next week for Rogers and and hall and then you've got a really strong team going forward I definitely don't hate it it's just how much damage Harland can do but if you're worried about City's potential in the last few weeks with all the you know all the uncertainty and injuries then no I mean they'll score goals they'll score they'll score at Chelsea and they'll score goals against Hit they'll probably score three or four goals against Chelsea against Hit witch but obviously having Salah and Trent is is not a bad bad tradeoff either and if I can get foden on the pitch against hwit then I should get some points if they do run right I won't have the captaincy on Harland I'll have it on Salah at home to brenford but then that could easily turn I away couldn't it I it's obviously a massive gamble to go not go Harland but I just think if we're sitting here with nine players the same you know do I do I want that you know at this stage in in my I hesitate to say fbl career but that's what it is right at this stag in my FPL career I'm more about the content than I am about getting good ranks to be honest because I'm lucky enough to be in a position where I can come half a million in the world and no one really gives throws shade on me or makes me think I've got little to offer um I'm lucky I've got a lot of stock in the bank so I mean yeah they have you you haven't actually finished half million the world I did last year can confirm lots of shade yeah I know but then you know I've perhaps got a bit more credit in the bank than you I hesitate to say but yeah I mean I think that's more than fair so I'm lucky in that respect so if there's anyone out there who can play for fun obviously all the fbl winners they can play for fun every season they've won it nothing to prove I'm probably one of the few content creators who are lucky enough to be in a position where I can try a few things and you know there's other out there like this but I'm one of them and it won't at all affect you will it Mark because you're not the person to get but I I think since for came into the premag I know I know it'll be devasta I mean obviously if Haren goes off and but that's what people want people want to tune in to back the they challenge with one of us not having Harland and watch the agony on one of our faces right and I'm not doing it just for that but I think I'm doing it for the fun factor of sitting there with you on that Saturday evening and seeing that there's 2,000 people waiting to watch us and thinking this is going to end in tears probably for me and I don't mind taking that on for the sake of entertainment I never I never forget us us with I think it was 5,000 live when neither of us had Harland and he got a hat trick against Palace yeah I'll never I'll never F that that was yeah it's it's and like I say you know Panther says as his Joy this look at the glint in his eye watching this unfold like I set this into motion sending you my team yesterday when you realized we were too similar I know the thing is now I can't go back to having harand tomorrow night can I so I'd say I'm probably n I'm 90% certain not to have Harland so if there's ideas on how this team can be better without Harland I'll listen to it but you know um yeah thanks Ys yeah thanks a lot yeah and Billy be choking on his SE Bass with laughter won't he see it y said to me earlier she said oh I'm I'm thinking of going without without harand yeah do it I said you'll have to do match to day challenge with us because I will know from your reaction if harland's got five goals when you come out scaras just like running then I'm leaving I'm leaving the house honestly she won't be able to hide it will she so she's she's got to do it as well if she goes in with no Holland she's got to do it as well in fact we make her do it as well anyway right there's no way she should of course yeah she's definitely doing it yeah yeah yeah yeah because otherwise people who accuse us of her telling us the scores and that's happened last time she she she will yeah she she will have to do it and for anyone who isn't aware there will be match of the day challenge next week game week two on the Saturday Mark will be up in Hitchin we're GNA go for some C bass for Billy he's going to come here we're gonna put ourselves in this room and we're going to watch the games and and stream it so if that's the kind of thing that you think you'd like then make sure you get involved next week and just explain we're going to stream it not knowing the scores and that will include the forest score so not only got not only have I got the pain of probably watching harand destroy my Saturday if sampton beat Forest I imagine how miserable I'm gonna be on that day I mean I'm gonna be yeah if sampton fresh forest and harand gets a hat-trick I don't know where that's going to end for me so yeah you want to watch that probably the worst the worst for you is is uh Salah won't play until the next day oh my God so if harand does go off or even if he doesn't do that well you still don't actually you w actually know how well sellers imagine if they both blank I'm beginning Nigel I'm beginning to rethink this I think anyway we can get some people on now to maybe talk about and maybe Tau me out of it so it's fine oh yeah well we've we've got some people to get on we've also got about super chats to get through and it's okay because pip mentioned that piz that basically she's messaged me back pizza's on the side I put an oven on well she better turn that oven off because I'm not going to be in for a while uh there's chocolate brownie in the cake tin which Ed has made and it's delicious there you go so I've got treats waiting for me well I tell what we do I I'm gonna run Ed is my daughter not my cook by the way yes she's called Stephanie we haven't got a chef no shut uh yeah I'm going to take a quick bathroom break and put the starting soon back on yeah let's do that a beer as

well I've obviously I was obviously not very memorable last time because we met last I remember you last yeah no I remember yeah you were there because we did the live show we so I do remember but um no I knew you were coming I didn't know you were coming till today I saw you comment about it today you were coming to that so look at the comments for Nigel Absolut welcome Nigel says yela bloody hell says Matt Francis Tom Legend Nigel in the house have we destroyed the myth because obviously people see what you look like now and so on it's like yes yes it's disappointment I should imagine no never next to as me you're always going to look good you're fine how's your how's your team set up Nigel you you ready uh no not really I've been I've been overthinking it I've been working on the premise of doubling up based on relationships between players so I've been looking at the the har and de bruyne double up and this is going to get me pelters I've been looking at the pitar and Bowen double up as well whoa not not like you to be left field normally play it play it straight down the line then you no I mean yeah like to Plum the depths of the the lower end of the table but yeah so I've um I also was looking up uh isach as well and the majority of his penalties were all won by Gordon so I've been looking up the Gordon eak double up as well yeah I I I think that you G I think Gordon won six or seven penalties didn't he last season for him yeah six penalties yeah he has that Knack of just getting his leg in front of the defender and drawing I mean some of them are really really dubious as well but you would not be surprised to see him repeat that would you you really wouldn't yeah so I'm I'm looking at Fernandez as well so I mean I try your connection or is it I'm connected fine I'm all good must be yeah no no it's all good oh yeah it's must be me then sorry you dropped out then for a second no worries I was just saying I'm looking at Fernandez as well I'm thinking kind of over over the course of season Fernandez looks a better deal than Salah really what Bruno Bruno over Sal just because of the difference in price not just that I think as well with the it's it's kind of make or break for tenh har isn't it now it and over the summer there are certain players Internationals that have really shown up and Bruno's got to bring that form now into the Premier League and with I I'm going to I'm going to eat my words here is probably going to score over 200 points I make this and the people will be clipping this and it'll come back to haunt me but I just feel that this is kind of make or break now with the team that they've assembled at United Bruno really has to step up he can't be walking around the pitch complaining as he has before he's really got to show that that Captain caliber yeah so for that n with Bruno team that gives you something big to cheer doesn't it is I am tempted for that reason as well to be honest I don't go with Bruno I'm gonna I will get pelters so I've kind of tied myself into it now 166 points last season 19 attacking returns he's always he's been a steady Eddie isn't he for the last three three years 244 points he got four four years ago but never got anywhere near those those Heights again I don't hate it but I don't love it is where I see I think on that one I've got a Gibbs white Theory do you want to hear that um Lee carsley Lee Carley is the new New England manager right and Lee carsley picked Gibbs white as the overage player in the under 21s um which they won with Palmer one side goldon the other and Gibbs Wyatt playing kind of force nine withdrawn nine position Gibbs White's never had a better chance of getting into an England squad we know there's International breaks to come now I'm not saying that Gibbs white doesn't give 100% normally there's no question when when Gibbs white saw carsley become England manager he would have thought like this is my chance if I shine first three game weeks I could be in that Squad um I do wonder whether that could be that little bit extra that marginal gain that just gives gives white that push over those early fixtures so that's why when I I think you asked tonight where where the best 65 money going I just give Gibbs white at the edge for the first CLE he didn't have a great preseason though did he he's all right but he wasn't our sharpest player but there's no question all the good stuff comes through and um no no major returns um but I so he got less less than three returns right yeah yeah but you can't read anything into preseason returns necessar you shouldn't read too much into it he'll be our best player he'll be Central to everything he won't be on all the set plays because Danilo and and alanga have been taking corners but I think in a that allows him to get in the boxer set plays and he's actually a threat in the air so I I mean I do think the carsley thing could be it's pure speculation but there would have been a glint in Gibbs White's eye when he saw that appointment and he's never gonna have a better chance of getting an England squad obviously to do that he's got to perform over those first three games there's no question Balou Sav Anon wolves give him a platform obviously Wolves at home we know we know he scored last season against wolves I can't believe you're not starting with him I can't believe team he may well be by tomorrow I'm I'm looking at it I'm looking at it going you know do I want son or a couple of 65 so I'm looking at it yeah anyone could play your team tomorrow could be anyone it's load of random I know I'm I'm so open to persuasion so it's Nigel you know you can I don't think you can talk me into patalo want to go yeah P yeah um yeah he he is he's really I suppose my only only concern with um about Forest Midfield is that Nuno is really pragmatic I mean how attacking do you really expect Gibbs white to be in a going of very because he can quite Dow sometimes luno yeah I mean we will be catching beyond the break that we that we get goals I think that sthampton away will probably be strangely the most profitable fixture for Gibs white over the three I think the home games Bournemouth and wolves they're not naive enough to think that they're going to come at us and give us chances to transition and break on them um so I think breaking teams down at home teams that come and defend will be that's a problem I think I think away from home and against teams that are are stronger and will come at us at the city ground that's where we perhaps have more more joy on the break we've got a bit more about us I would say sangary gives us somebody who can pass between the lines from the six we didn't really have that last season we relied on Millo to really get the ball to Gibbs white in space sangari has done that preseason so I think there's a little bit more about us and if Anderson plays in the Danilo role he's got he's got some creative creativity in his game as well so I do think we're a better side and we will will break teams down better but it's not a huge leap there's no question out of the three games I think Gibbs white could get double figures at Southampton but maybe get assist or two against bourou from wolves but that's still good enough for 65 I still think versus in K has got City first game I think he will still come out on top out of the six FS where of Millo he's had a few gaffs in him J preseason and he G away two or three penalties like just swinging at Players maybe three two gave away three pens two pens okay a goal and two no he's been he's been AB in preseason I don't know whether he's not fit or he's mind is elsewhere but we got to play him because he's just special that is a risk yeah but I mean bmer from wolves how much have they got to offer up front they're not the strongest in those areas now if salanki was turning up on Saturday I'd be very worried but it won't be it'll be probably s meno playing up top and milanovic looks quality so I think we will strong will be stronger there anyway enough for Forest let's get let's get some some um some super chats up should we we've got yeah I was gon I was gonna say n you you're on the other side you're on the other side now nor you sending in you happy to help us answer answer absolutely be yes absolutely um so this is from F uproar um Kamar we mentioned him earlier in the Stream Mark he was part of your 55 and under picks that we that we talked about on the last episode and he was actually in my first draft the first draft I created I looked back on it and kamada um was in there I've sort of pivoted away from him and gone to Smith row now but is he a good replacement for e and also here some money for us as well which is very very generous yeah NJ would you reckon on on kamada in the five5 bracket uh yes and no so um I did some research into kamada prior to playing under glasner he was actually more of a goal threat under glasner he got more assists so he will play a slightly deeper position so if um if e is still there and you've got e and Sarang Mana Wing there's a good chance you'll see kamada playing in central Midfield playing um basically defense splitting passes just say can I just say Nigel can I just say just really quickly you never know who you're going to get on when you just stick a a link in the Discord you have you've come like you are the best guest you've come armed with knowledge and opinions and your microphone's half decent fair play I'd like to think anyone who watches this show religiously like Nigel does would would bring that to the party so yeah but yeah I'm not surprised like to think that but I don't believe it so yes or no with kamada so yes or no depends where he plays if he plays further forward then yeah he's he's he is International Quality he's a good player but if he plays further back then you the most you're going to get is an assist out of him is he gonna start because they got his malasar now right so is malasar is gonna play on the right that that side and he's gonna be he's gonna be somewhat inverted is he playing closer to the striker um I presume it's going to be Edward up to top io's on his way out isn't he we think that he's going to be so it'll be e one side and presumably um yeah it'll be sa on the other so where's kamada gonna play in the 10 do you think you think that's where he's going to be uh well it depends glaser's got a thing for three four he's got a thing for playing a qu a quite a flat Midfield because he likes the two Wingers to come inside and play as number 10 if that's the case then G more probably as a traditional Central midfielder if if he plays Walton and Hughes then yeah there's a good chance that kamado will move further forward you but he's so versatile it makes him a difficult pick it's it's Kamar and wasar to start I think that's the thing and I think he will get the start over s because he's got more minutes in in preseason and s's only just arrived two goals last season two goals latio in 29 yeah wasn't a good move for him well he was he was at he was at Frankfurt for six years and he got 20 goals in 127 so he's he's not he's not an out andout goal scorer but I've I've watched him a few times and he's a he's a good player he's you know's he's a classy player who clearly is very talented it's just has he got a a classy talented player isn't always a great FPL asset whereas I think Smith row is good whereas kamada not too sure I think it's a wait and see for me I think he's in that bracket of five five mids that could break out but the fixtures again brenford West Ham Chelsea um I just and it depends on E doesn't it if if if e could if a could leave the club then that's going to be disruptive isn't it and he's such an important player for them so yeah no no what was that comment I missed that was that a Simon for a place ass I mean that yeah no we did we didn't say that thises go down that way the man put him on speed although although my place is is we won't talk about your rank last season Simon don't talk about we definitely don't talk about ranks on this budy on this buddy stream um next Super Chat uh someone said we missed super chats we definitely haven't I'm just we're going back to 8:46 p.m I remember that time do you remember that time uh this is from George Prince Smith row moon is double up to risky benching ESR game week one Mark and I both have him on the bench currently uh njel where are you with Smith row is he in your have you got any any F players as we'd like to call him yes mre's definitely in the thinking I mean you I mean you only had to see how Dynamic he was for arsenal when he was playing for them a couple of seasons ago I mean that's special um and I I would still fancy him to get to cause problems for United given how open their Midfield is so even though they've got deled mrai and I expect mrai to invert to create a bit more cover in central Midfield to be United I still think that you know filam are gonna have acres and acres to run into and I think that you know Smith would be a real threat are you are you playing in him yes are you yeah that that is their weakness the weak the weakness for United is that holding Midfield role they've never really got it right for a couple of Seasons they've not really got that player in yet who set all do can plug that Gap and Smith R lives in that pocket so um it is definitely a tense watch if you're benching him it is tempting isn't it I mean you you think I should play him don't you over qu I think I think you should play one of them over Quan yeah um I guess the question is is it Smith row or moon is which is also the question kind of with in that Super Chat as well they've got munes and an ESR um although it sounds like they're thinking of playing munes would I play both of them no would I be comfortable playing one of them yeah yeah I think so I would I I wouldn't want them both on the bench they should get something in that thanks very much did did you see that that that comment I just put on the screen uh from Matt Francis not saying this is a long stream I've cooked dinner for the family eaten it did a YouTube quiz washed up and you're still going haven't had any dinner yet I'm going to be hallucinating where's your pizza my pizza's inside I turned the oven off there's no point leaving it on it's just wasting the gas and I'm just burning the gas there Holly's in the chat saying hello to you there Simon hi Holly it's good to see you good to see you yeah good to see I don't think Holly's gonna be at Fest so we're gonna miss her at fest tomorrow but oh that is a shame I saw foco in the chat he's he is gonna be at at Fest and obviously Andy's going to be there as well um let's go for Matt Duncan thank you for the Super Chat am I crazy for thinking BR and Diaz is being way overlooked he was good for a terrible shev United team and Southampton are going to attack I think it's going to be a terrible Southampton team I'm I'm afraid to say he's not he's not on my radar is he on yours Mark he's not but I was looking at rate my team the other night and if you go Max price 6.5 midfielders he's top as a 5.5 midfielder so the the rate my team algorithm wrongly fancies baretton Diaz I don't know why that would be it's a bit must they can I can only presume they think he's going to play up the top and they're not giving enough goals to Armstrong I don't know but they really he's a bit of a cult figure isn't he like people were really into BRZ and hez like I know um Hindu monkey is like his biggest fan and other people on Twitter have maybe got a goal from him last season think he's you know the next big thing not too sure saon will attack at home but I don't you know away at Newcastle I mean yeah I mean Forest gameweek two he's a former Forest player he scored against us for Sheffield United and kissed a badge which didn't go down very well I think he's gonna enjoy playing Us game we too so he's not a Bad Bet there and you know brenford United it which they've got fairly good fixtures other than that open day I just think there are better there are better options around I wouldn't go him over Smith Row for example just unless you're going two five5 then you don't you don't look at him or unless you correct which would be incredible if that's the points he gets I'm just looking at what they predict game by game week six 25.9 three points I just don't see that so he strikes me as a bit of a [ __ ] the crb pick he does he's been on my radar but only but I will qualify it is that this is a guy that despite how I mean he's a low price and he looks like a kind of a a a strange but he scored goals at International level so he's he's no slouch and he tends to he tends to lurk in the penalty area I mean he doesn't look the most athletic but he's he's got a B about it would I pick him over Smith row no no no I agree with that um just wanted to mention the irony of answering the super chats is because they were two hours ago there's no way off of these people are still they still hanging around I don't think I could time you never know they might tune in later before the deadline tomorrow FY fazy are you still here are you still with us thank you very much I'm not sure how much 110 try is but it's gold so I think that's quite a big one so thank you very much um Trenta Muno or Gabrielle and CBA double Arsenal defense oh I just I feel a bit shaky about a double a double defense at that price both being six six million feels a little bit Overkill I think I'd spread the risk and go for Trent and munas would did you see what Ashley sent us I just want to sorry n you go first and I'll prepare what Ashley sent us as go on the no I do you know I saw that email and then completely forgot to read it sorry sorry Ashley you go you go first s and I'll bring in Ashley's content she's very good no I'm actually going to agree with as um and I'm only going to agree with as because I did have both Gabrielle and Celia on my team but I looked at the fixtures and I thought I'd have just have major fomo if Alexander Arnold delivers and I've lost a clean sheet against Aston Villa in in the second game week so I thought no for me I think the two the two attacking fullbacks there and mun and mun as well I mean he was very good for Colombia in the coper America so he looks a sound pick yeah he's I I I had him for both his double digit Halles last season in a what was can only be described as a awful awful season from start to finish he was one of the few who came out of that with any any shred of any should of dignity in my in my side and I feel like the more players they lose almost the more prominence he might get in terms of that creativity and and taking on a bit more of a goal scoring goal scoring role because he was so Advanced last season so I like the moono I think Trenton moono they're two very attacking Defenders you're going to watch every game of Liverpool Palace and think they're gonna get something Gabriel and S is a bit more bit more dull what have you got for me Mark so asley Chapel who's your he's kind of like your your your Tactical Joker he comes up with these he is he's brilliant he comes up with these golden nuggets I mean it's only a matter of time before you claim them as your own and don't mention Ashley at all when you turn up with these just phas him out yeah yeah would but he more for you but I'll I'll I'll put it in Ashley don't worry Asar has turned his back on you um so what was interesting I can't I haven't got the graphics but he sent us um a study he' done of Arsenal set pieces in preseason and what he noticed was when calori was on the pitch um he's a player obviously new signing who's strong in the air and he noticed that there was a change in the set piece setup the corner setup now why is this important is because Cela and Gabrielle were obviously monsters at set plays last season Arsenal I think scored the most goals from from Corners in than any other Premier League side so it is a factor when you're picking celra and Gabriel one of the things is in your head is they can get me two or three goals or even more over the season but he noticed when Cal ferari was on the pitch there was a change in roles and Ben White was kept back in defense and not the player who pinned the goalkeeper and it was CBA who was pinning the goalkeeper and his theory is that theyve that um Aleta is feeling that calori offers something stronger in the air even than CBA whereas CBA has got the bigger frame to pin the goal keeper even bigger frame than Ben White and so his view is that we could see cba's threat from set plays reduced because his role won't be to attack the ball that'll be on cury and Gabrielle cba's role will be to pin the goalkeeper now he'll still be in the mix and he can still get a second ball but he won't be attacking the first ball from Corners so that if that Rings true now it's a very small data sample but it's an interesting one and one to look for so if you go into the season with celba watch for corners and watch what his role is when Cur is on the bench on the pitch because Ashley thinks he might have spotted something yeah golden golden that is thank you Ashley very very good I mean you don't really get celba for goal threat though do you like he's not he's never someone who I would back to get a goal but you've got that in the back of your mind I think you're because Arsenal was so strong at Corners last season that you think you're going to get two to three goals out of him as well over the season I do I would I mean if I was getting Gabrielle in i' would be thinking well you know it's not just because it's not just I might as well get Ry for five five but the reason why I go Gabriel for six is because perhaps he's more likely to get bonus if he scores a goal and he should get three to four goals over the season given what we saw from Arsenal set pieces and for Gabrielle that might well be true but if Ashley's right with the theory that CBA is suddenly pinning the keeper we might see a downturn in his goal output what did CBA get last season he got at least a couple didn't he got two two goals yeah okay two gos yeah Gabrielle is the is the larger threat no question and you might be right people aren't getting CBA for goal threat but it might be just something to watch for um just to see if Cal Fury califi at six million could be the player to get because he is very strong in the air and maybe artess has seen that already and he could be the one he's he's definitely the exciting one at six is just waiting for him to to nail down that role at left back um do you agree with Nigel and I though that Trent and moono over Gabrielle and CBA I'm a Vibes player this season so you got to go Tren oh in for the Clicks in for those clicks uh op talent I op Talent was in the Q&A earlier as well good to see you uh here if you're still around I I don't think um I don't think the last one was was around I said say say hello in chat if you've been here from the start let's have a look let's see who's been if you've done if you've done 2 hours three minutes let let us know op Talent thank you for the Super Chat fleen and Henderson the rotation pairing that you like Mark and S and Gabrielle and a 4.0 or Rea and a I find some of these so confusing to read out fleen and Henderson and sber SL Gabriel okay so it's flecking and so it's a rotating 4.5 and an Arsenal defender or reyer and rotating Moon oen Hall there you I'll put it on the screen because that might help but thank you yeah okay so fle hasn't rotating plus with celra or Gabrielle and a four million or reyya and a four million and the four million is irrelevant because they both have the four million anyway so you can forget about that I prefer reyya over an Arsenal Defender obviously because that's what I've got in my team at the moment because it's the N five more I don't think I don't think bonus is going to come the way of any Arsenal Defender very readily I mean I think CRA only got six bonus last season and that was what with have 18 clean sheets so I don't think there's a massive gap between reyya and and the center backs and we've just said that we could see a change in the output goals from set plays so I prefer reyer therefore I'm going to go the second option because obviously Hall gets you potential clean sheet game we while moonar is attacking and we said earlier we're not really keen on rotating keepers are we because we don't trust ourselves to get it right what do you reckon Nigel Simon what should we call you I'm I'm using both interchangeably it's finea I um so I I was looking on FPL review and ryer is is rated the best 5.5 asset in the entire game so yeah I'm gonna have to go with that I'm gonna have to go with ryer I I I mean flein rated as the best 4.5 asset for any position as well but he's just got so many mistakes in him I think you know ryer is just a nice set and forget I mean you can keep him for the season yeah that's it I mean I regretted not getting Ry last season and for obvious reasons I had Gabrielle for all the season I believe but I really wanted to double up and I just never got on it um and yeah he had his mistakes in him but I think that um there's no you know there's no ramsdale I don't think ramsdale is going to be a threat because I don't think ramsdale is going to be there I think he'll move off so for me I think not not five you can do something with yeah hoping he comes to the city ground as well and I yeah I am keeping an eye on curri though I do think that could be the way I go if I get a second Arsenal player in and when the when the when the fixtures get better when their path is opening run and there are spells where you know I would want to double up on maybe an arsal defense but do I want to when there's Villa Spurs and city in the first five probably not I'll just stick with ryer uh I just want to shout out to everyone who said hello to your comment Mark about having been here from the start it's genuinely coup of no few just I just find it stuff like that overwhelming like the fact you would sit here and listen to us ramble on for three h said hi so H's been here ages she did say she's only sticking around for Simon now though so you know she kind of I imagine I I imagine that that's a lot of people doing that but to have nearly two and half thousand people watching for this long like just thank you so much it means yeah a lot to us uh and I also wanted to shout out to Paul um because Y and I went to Copenhagen and I was leading us to the uh the hotel and I took us to the wrong Hotel hotel which is very me and we ended up in like a a bar over the road and as we walked in the guy was like are you as some yell there like I watched your streams and came over and we and we chatted to to Paul for for a while um so yeah it's funny to see him in the chat so yeah hi Paul good to see you again you said that in chat and I said he recognized Yen the first and he just realized it was you oh and you're that other guy that she know yeah yeah obviously yeah we we we we get that a lot that's fine um Ken Grove thank you for the Super Chat perro and Gordon and holding 0.5 in the bank versus Trent and Gibbs white oh that's close what do you think n yeah I'm I've go for n now you go n Go on oh it for the start of the Season it'd have to be por and Gordon as the season progresses I think i' be tempted to switch Yeah I mean the Lesser asset there on price oh actually Po's I I really like Po but Gibs white is probably the Lesser asset of the four there um for the reasons Nigel said I think there' be Tom games where we struggle to break teams down unless unless Nuno really amps up the attacking aspects of our game which could happen but it's not going to happen straight away and like you say the opening fixtures favor porro and golden don't they you know it's I do I do love porro I haven't had him I don't think he's left my team since I built it I think he's been in there all the time gold has gone in and out with the maybe RIS to his minutes but I think he could end up back in by tomorrow um so yeah I I concur with n I think it's po golden and the not five could be really handy would you I think so yeah I mean does it have to be Gibbs white could it be en kunu or or Bailey um you know I think they're better I think they're better options you're blowing my FY out of the water then I just I just love Trent as an option the first few weeks I don't you know I know por has got a good first couple of games but I think Trent could be someone that you keep much longer term than that and then Gordon there there's a bit of uncertainty around his his minutes and his start game with one and I think there's some good other six five assets and Gibs white is a good pick as well but you picked one of the other ones I think he's really close I think I'd favor towards the option with Tren but there's not much in it is a good one look Leo Leo is good question for Mark Hudson Ado start tomorrow I nearly corrected him by saying well it's not tomorrow is it because we play Saturday I know you're going to say that time is it hold on it's only an hour to go before it is right anyway he is gonna start he is gonna start against bouth yes yeah whether he'll start after gameweek three and four because I think Anderson will be a factor and I don't think necessarily Anderson gets himself into the first 11 yet but there will be rotation we are we are signing more Wingers we've signed um we've signed Roman sza um paraguayan Winger um who's one well the best player in the Argentinian League I'm led to believe goal scoring very direct Winger plays on the left could play down the middle could play on the right but he favors the left therefore I presume that's going to eat into HS on Theo's minutes around gameweek three and four so just be wary of that but as a starting player 55 yeah he'll start against Bournemouth he'll start as sampton and he'll probably start against walls but he will he will give up minutes there you go um one this is from Emanuel if not Bob then MCAT and I saw that and thought No One's Gonna be picking M do you know many attacking returns M got last season both of you have a guess eight not far off well I'll go nine then in that case he got he got seven attacking returns oh there you go which isn't which isn't bad given he wasn't exactly playing for a great side he's playing for the worst side in the Premier League well yeah playing playing for the absolute worst side so I mean there's obviously there's question marks around his minutes but you've got to think if he's if he's going to be given the chance and I think he will play the first game maybe he is a bit of a a bob equivalence is he five I haven't even looked at his price yeah he's five five million same same price as Bob yeah five five million him he he doesn't want to loan him he doesn't want to sell him he's he made the comment recently about how he got great uh ball control en tight areas so I think m is definitely one that's being looked at for the future yeah maybe maybe's a bit too this is the season where pep eases him in and then next season could be the one where he might get more regular starts so um yeah just saying um techers here saying three hours of absolute go dust I can listen to this on my dog you are spoing your dog I was gonna say I can only presume you've got dogs that need a lot of energy taken out of them because three hours is a a good com from bur as well he says T you can't change the players in a super chat you told Sam that on your earlier stream if anyone saw the Q&A I did with Sam she's very good at like she's given two options and then she just goes well don't go for any of them go for this third one it's like no you've got to pick out of the options that's the whole point of these these questions so yeah I would admit I was guilty of that uh Steve Burton thoughts on sacka and salang versus son and habits this is a question we had earlier actually we were pretty um unanimous on on this one but yeah what do you think Mark I think it's clear is yeah it's Gotta Be Right do you agree with that Nigel yes no brainer yes no brainer especially the fact that you got salanki now playing for an even more attacking team than what um than bouth were so yeah for me it's second there you go Steve we smashed that one this because I want to get opinions on this because there's been a debate on whether if if salanki had been at Spurs from the GetGo would he be 75 what' you reckon to that no no he would where would he be he'd be closer to 10 because just yeah just because the Shar volume of chances that Spurs so 442 did a great piece on this a couple of days ago that the reason why Spurs struggled is because they just couldn't put the ball in the net richison was playing far too deep wasn't wasn't attacking enough you put someone like and he's going to be gobbling up those chances yeah James as well didn't he 85 yeah I was thinking 85 yeah jump from some which is maybe maybe nine but I'd probably put A5 yeah well that and when you think about that then that kind of makes out your mind that he's got to be in your team I mean that that's why it's interesting I think that his signing for Spurs does make moving off harand more more palatable because suddenly you've got another striker in that bracket along with e Zack and Watkins and maybe Tony that can compensate for not having Harland if obviously you're getting solo and Trent in the team as well so I think San's move did maybe change the dial a little bit on the move towards har we've seen a lot of traffic go harland's way I don't know where it's going this way I'm going to bring up the scout app to see what's happening on that because they've got a decent view of um recent transfer activity and who's coming in who's out um yeah yeah so harland's not in the top five ownership changes in the last 24 hours so it's slowed down but salanki is he's gone up 1.7% in the last 24 hours and I wouldn't be surprised you know J's top with a 2% increase those moves for jot and salanki I wonder you know I wonder how much of that is seeing traffic move a little bit more away from Harland I think it probably is it's probably flattened out a bit since do you think more people are going to panic though close to the deadline and sunny bring Harlem back in yeah of course including me probably yeah no that wasn't Nigel I know you're laughing because you think that's anti- Harem propaganda and it wasn't I wasn't this is it you get you you do something crazy like not getting Harland and you get accused at the end of that and I don't blame people but I wasn't doing that honestly yeah well clickit move on no no no I wasn't no it's fine Prett you literally said you were click baiting within your rant oh oh yeah not getting not getting yeah yeah uh zir you are the wire not the FPL wire the V wire compared to mainstream fluff wow take that slippers congrats I've had hun to the toy and Bruno all summer now neither I'm wobbling talk me off Bowen versus a shaky Aston Villa so Bowen Hudson adoy and Bruno I don't like any of those pics particularly zir um we talked about Bowen earlier Nigel was talking lot about Bruno obviously a big fan and and Mark you think Hudson D is going to start so guess we're a bit hotter on those two than we are than Bowen no I think Brun I think Bowen's more likely to return than H and he's he's a better player better finisher H AO lot of goals last year eight goals but I think he had next to foden he outperformed his XG by the biggest margin so we expect some aggression might not come they might not be able to stop Hing aoy cutting inside and cing them in but um I would if I was if they were the same price I'd be going Bing obviously the difference in price means husand ofo is you know that extra two million that's useful right so I wouldn't it' be very close I'll probably go HUD oror for game week one given the fixtures and the two million but I think you know Bo's not I mean you you obviously are on boen Nigel right because you're looking at the yeah the relationship with pakar and yeah I just I just think as well with B now he's Captain he's he's now for 90 minutes just like Bruno pretty much is so and I just I rate hat Ado always have even back in his days at Chelsea but there's just something about I just I'm not certain he's going to get the 490 and there's a lot of change there's a lot of change at Forest as well which obviously you know better than I do so just not I'm just not I'm just not set on him Jack Flash is saying can we morph this into a 24-hour stream stream if we weren't going to Fest maybe oh God I I think I got about another 20 minutes in me and then one day we should try for that 24 hours oh my God yeah oh charity to community to you again yeah yes thank you thank you Mark it's nice to have I'm still awake uh Alin fedick uh Rogers and Robinson versus Hudson adoy and Johnson I would go Rogers and Robinson all day uh hon oror and Johnson is he mean Ben Johnson right yeah that's easy that's that's an easy one Alin straight to Rogers and Robinson right Nigel yeah yeah easy easy street where' you stand on the Watkins starting Nigel what's your opinion oh that's a tricky I mean so is there anything confirmed from Emory that's actually said that he's not that he's got concerns around vins I suppose that would be my question would Emy say that probably he might he might want to to I haven't seen any quotes on him yet but we conf tomorrow isn't it yeah we'll get him tomorrow won't we I think he starts I think there's no way that yeah I think he's too good not to start he had a good Euros as well you know you think me that that goal that he scored against Holland he was buzzing after that I'd be surprised if he doesn't start and I think Rogers plays on the left zero minutes though zero preseason minutes then Chuck straight back in in a quite tough away game don't associate with injuries do yeah so maybe he feels he te on like and he's been on a training program that doesn't need preseason minutes and we they may have played in Pre closed doors we may not know about it I don't know I mean I'm really 5050 on it I'd love Rogers to start up top I think Rogers starts anyway and you know so he warrants he wants the selection yeah yeah um we got a lovely series of super chats now from swamir again uh so first one just says too much respect for United surely you start ES so that's a that your your team specifically Mark I think I might look at that because starting ESR yeah starting ASR will change the selection somewhat in terms of my squad selection um because like I've only got I've only got Lewis Hall in there because I need a someone who I think can return in game week one um but if I start ESR I don't necessarily need to go Lewis Hall I could get Robinson in and that would mean I've got the triple up on Fulham which I like for the fixtures to come so I will look at that yeah I mean in the what in the four hours we've got left before deadline I will look at [Music] that in the four hours we got left this stream I am joking the deadline's not in four hours you go bed it's fine it is uh zir again yes Mark don't blame it is uh don't mat today Harland nothing one and three nothing I'd love that but it's not going to happen is it and uh you've got you're gonna have to watch game week two so yeah not not really what you want to here uh Liverpool and both teams to score is a lock you had the were you you three nil Liverpool right and I was four1 yeah 3 nil yeah I mean yeah it s got it swi will have goals in them um I mean Nigel promoted sides do you which one's going to start the strongest do you think that is um that is a really difficult question to answer I mean I I think that the IP switch are really unknown quantity in the Premier League because McKenna was highly sought after I mean United were looking after him so I think IP switch will cause more surprises than we expect but I think there's something about Martin a manager at Southampton I think that we'll see some shocks down at Southampton so yeah yeah yeah yeah I think we'll see some shocks at Southampton yeah if I'm gonna set my neck on the Block I'm G have to go for Southampton yeah I mean they've got the Firepower with Armstrong and probably Diaz who you know between them could get 10 goals each you never know if they have a good season um I think they got a bit more Firepower about them so you think Martin's football will translate well to the Premier League do you think it'll it will click well in the when you look at how he set up for most of the Season it was like a 433 quite attacking formation and he was just he was they were peppin things they scored a lot of goals but when it come to the the harder matches he changed to a back three and he in the semifinal yeah he did yeah and I think he'll do the same I don't think he's gonna go all get I think away from home he's gonna play a really tight kind of medium medium to low block at home against smaller teams like soip which I think he's going to go for it I think that's so I I I fancy that Southampton will be a surprise but probably still get rated I mean as if you think you've seen Tippy tappy passing wait until you see a Russell Martin team honestly they have players that are literally two feet apart going tip tip tip tip tip like honestly it's just EXT it's extraordinary um that's how swansey was when they came to the city I've never seen anything like it um so it's just going to be really interested how that translates if he tries that yeah it only just about worked to get him up let alone like Burnley a great possession style type of football which didn't translate to Premier League it won't work I'm sorry fans Nigel is right he did adapt he did adapt certainly for the playoffs as well we saw it so he might well change it but I think his passing philosophy his possession philosophy will stay the same so we'll see see I'm going I'm yeah I'm going have to order some food I'm absolutely starving I might order a kebab can you get it room I've had three beers yeah I think I need I think I need to get I'm star I haven't eaten any dinner either we've been doing okay is your just ready and cold no no it's not in the oven yet I've got to cook it and do the Fest quiz and do the I mean I'll be up till God knows when yeah uh right I want to take this next one then I'm going to order myself a kebab we've got so many super chats that they've paid for my Kebab tonight so I appreciate that uh next one also from Z his first his last one great team apart from bench Smith we've already covered that man united suck is he talking to my is he talking about my team there it must be so that's all yeah okay good I like that Z keeps paying you 199 to tell you to play Smith row I'm getting the message of here it's coming through five Super chats left this is from Paul Hayes uh kdb surely an option tell me why not I hand this over to you Nigel and I'm going to W my Kebab he doesn't start does he n h do you know what that's a i it's funny I was watching the highlights of Belgium versus Romania earlier as you do and he was absolutely outstanding during the Euros he's barely played since and I just got a feeling pep wants to lay down a market for the start of the season I if foden doesn't play i' I've got a feeling that the bruyne starts I just got a feeling he starts it was funny I was going to ask AZ earlier do you think Pep's going to Spring a surprise or two with that lineup and having said that they're going to be phased back in that he will just throw them in for game we one so I I do suspect you might be right that we might get one or two surprises and either one of foden or B de boy ends up in the starting 11 we didn't expect it out of necessity now it's like I said earlier like Bob has taken out some goal threat some creativity and is he going to go into the Chelsea game relying on the likes of you doku and and greish and Silvera and mcy or is he going to turn to the Staples at least one of them so I think you could be right but it's just knowing what he'll do I mean to play Pet roulette on gameweek one with the amount of money you needs to get either kdb or foden in it's a big risk isn't it I mean he doesn't play the 90 I mean I almost certainly would play the 90 but I I think he features and I think that Harland is is a much better player when De Bron is on the pitch of course yeah yeah yeah don't see it have you gone chili sauce as or oh yeah of course a a mixed chicken and lamb shish wrap and cheese I Haven never dinner and you're I don't want to know you're making me hungry it's like I'm G to F it's so hot in this shed as well it's like an endurance test this is you know you know that that raw dog thing when the P people sitting in a plane staring at something that's what I feel like I've just been staring at the screen with no foodand tweet yeah hang on sorry just just just just ordering yeah you should we take the next one let's have a look um okay DAV family first thank you very much for the Super Chat wooden Johnson or Pedro and 4.5 Defender AIA Barco wooden Johnson so that's Chris W and Ben Johnson or Pedro and a 4 five Defender oh dear I mean wood will play the first three games won't he I think as I said earlier Pedro May will be a rotation risk as soon as a new players settle so there's not much in that but Pedro's got penalties it depends who the four five Defender is I mean I think you could get quono obviously and I really like quo at 4 five so I'd probably go Pedro in the four five what you reckon n yeah I would as well and the thing about hler as well um a a feature of the his poy team was that the whoever played center forward had a tendency to drop in the Midfield and play in linol passes so and I think that really plays the Pedro's game as well so I think that you'll probably find that with Pedro there's going to be a lot more basically the system is really going to work for the Wingers and Pedro is going to be arriving late getting on the end of it so for me I'd be going Pedro and a 4.5 but it depends on the 4 five I'm I'm not by any of the I'm not sold on M I'm certainly not sold on the palace 4.5s so that's a tricky one for me the 4.5 maybe con even then if you don't have Trent then Quan's good I mean I think canate will get minutes and when the Champions League kicks in we'll know more about the rotation between the two of them but I think quansa starts it switch brenford and then you need another player to bring in to maybe bench him at United because I think if if Kate is going to get a start it will be at United maybe I think he is a better Defender than quona but yeah he brings extra quality on the ball doesn't he and and Slot likes that we can see it yeah can is a bit of a barn door really isn't he he's just sort of like he just the ball Just Hits him whereas qu's definitely got he's got a bit of calm and a certain level of technique that slot wants from his Central Defenders I think that Phillips actually has as well who probably won't get a look in is a similar style player he was linked with us for a while yeah I forgot about him as well he n your audio quality suddenly got really bad and I don't know why I don't know if it's like a loose connection or oh that's better that's whatever you did in that second fixed it it was really good yeah well it was fine though it was really good at the start and it's it's just Dr his dropped down um thanks to Lee who's uh G me 499 to help with my Kebab my Kebab order appreciate that see Sam Le tomorrow aren't we I say tomorrow that isn't it yes it is it is still tomorrow yeah sorry we're now at three hours 3 hours 20 uh great comment as well from uh oh God where is it Tom Nigel should these to be a frequent guest yeah done BR absolutely absolutely brilliant um that's Paul done Davies Family First yeah what I Wasing myab good Chris Chris asso Rank top three rodri Murphy Smith r m Bailey Bailey's a bit more says rodri to be fair I would go Bailey no I'd go Smith row Bailey M Mark same I'd go bayy Smith row M I think I think bayy over the season will probably outscore Smith row but the difference have been marginal probably and the 1 million defense yeah so if if it's just in terms of points Bailey Smith r m um but Smith is the best asset there isn't he best asset in terms of value is Smith row there rodri I was surprised you know the returns he got last season uh and he actually got more I think it was more double digits in home matches than Harland he got six double digit returns in home matches rodri which is crazy 18 in total 18 attacking returns for Rod yeah yeah so harand four like Madison or h greish they bite your hands off for 18 attacking returns yeah harand got four double digits at home and Ry got six which I just didn't expect to see yeah ridiculous absolutely ridiculous um Shivan you still here you still with us 1055 there's a chance that Shivam is still still watching uh J Pedro and Gordon or salanki and basically any 5.5 mid look into wild card in game week eight jedro and Gordon or sank and a 55 Mark I think sanki and a 55 sanki and Smith row really with the way I'd be going um he hasn't listed Smith row there which I'm surprised that but salanki and Murphy give you that shortterm promise for game week one obviously Murphy will start we think against sampton um wild card game week eight I don't know whether that factors into it I guess the problem going Jia Pedro and Gordon Al Pedro's minutes will start to come under question three or four game weeks in and if you're not wild card into wa you might have a problem there you'd have to move him out and Yeah salanki and a 55 would be the way I go n agree with that yeah yeah yeah same as just just the first five to six fixtures really make I think is is close it is close though because again sank is a bit of a short-term pick with the first two but J Pedro given like the rotation and then it's Gordon versus a 55 and you'd expect Gordon to comfortably outscore the five five options but I I'd want sank I think sanki for the first two he's someone I've prioritized so and I think the five five options are still decent so I'd lean to that towards that one but I think it is it is close between them um this is from shaky Jake which could be my dog my dog there somewhere uh does har beat s Salah and sacka Midfield first six as in does he beat all three of them combined probably not does he beat the more individually yes I think so that's why I've got him right well I I've got the son Saka Midfield right so um I think that I'm obviously going to say no because that's what I'm going with probably um it's the captaincy though isn't it you know it's the captaincy in its gameweek two so what do we think the Gap will be between Harland and Salah gameweek two Salah at home to brenford Harland at home to itswitch we think we're taking it for granted it's going to be a drub in for it witch and that harland's goingon to do what he's done before which is a hattick against a promoted team that could happen and that could be the difference that could be the thing that swings it if you look if the captaincy didn't exist you'd have to say son Salas Saka would probably come out on top but that swings it so much doesn't it Nigel tell me to go son salaka I I I would love to you know highand scored what nearly was it over 60 goals in two seasons and I don't know I still think that you could build a Midfield that would be able to balance out the difference in points between those that three and hland so I I've got a yeah yeah I think I I I mean I I look at my Midfield of of you know sacka jotter Gordon there's still three obviously there's risks around jotter and things but there's still three proven Assets in terms of what they can deliver so although I am worried about I'm not well son okay he's not going to do too much damage though because he's not too highly owned obviously I'm worried about Salah but I do think you can still build a decent enough Team without um what brilliant pricing though for 15 million for him it's he has because if he was 13 million there wouldn't be any debate in this at all even at 14 15 that extra million goes goes a long way um I'm backing Harland because I've got him and if I did believe that Midfield would be better then I would go for that but it could go anyway you just never know well I'm gonna go good for you I'm glad to hear it uh oh we've had shaky Jake already FB uproar been loving this stream keep it up guys thank you hope you're still still tuning in my God the end's in sight I can see some blank space on the on the pins uh FPL family about my Kebab we've already had that one I get some chips of your Kebab yep I will do I've ordered those thank you very much Lee uh FP upro green arrows for everyone how how csome is that it's lovely is it it's what you need it's what you need when you're in turmoil like me so yeah thank you up uh Jordan spell I'm bench boosting in game week one not sure whether to go with fleen or Matt sells or sell Gabrielle for zinchenko and go Anana and upgrade Martinez to do how sure are you that sell starts Mark he'll start you gotta go him then right aru be the best goalkeeper game we won I'd say playing Bournemouth without any Striker yeah I think he's more likely to keep a clean sheet and fleen although you know Palace we don't know you know what they're going to turn I mean like I said E's really there they're key man they're missing Mareta obviously Alis not there but yeah I think I think sell's over fleen for game of one uh why has he got the option to sell Gabrielle for zenchenko and go onano and upgrade Martin no yeah just go sells yeah yeah yeah yeah uh and then n you've given us some good United analysis already on the stream so far dring around Martinez and DOW is that worth an upgrade an extra point. five uh no no if if you're get upgrade I I know this might be like a bit of a Maverick pick but I'd be going for someone like theit because I know that he's going to be an absolute beast from Corners so I'd be sticking with martinez although Martinez has got a gaff in him so I suppose that i' be wary of Martinez what Jordan A's said is when he's gonna wild card because I wouldn't go Matt sells unless you're wild card in early because SS will be out of that goal by going week four so I bear that in mind yeah good point you re D definely starts or you reckon it's going to be Maguire or Evans I think has to start yeah I think you're probably right there yeah good point uh good uh zir again thank you you've been very generous tonight thank you we really really appreciate all these all these super chats hate to say it because he's a spud but plil James has been incredible the last few weeks he is always incredible uh his brench boost is treated like a but I believe love that thoughts we talked about wek not we're not huge fans it's just because you have to commit to the Wild Card early and I'm not a fan of that necessarily um you know you you you've got to build a team with game week one in m to such an extent that You' then got to kind of get the wild card out early to maybe fix that unless it goes your way with the output over longer term but I mean James is happy with that and that's what he's going to do and maybe committing to the wild code early is going to be the right play but I just want to see how we start first and not build a team game we one with that in mind um as for the bench Booth we've said before it's just very difficult isn't it to know there's not going to be any outliers that take us by surprise with the team sheets like salanki suddenly not turning up or something which I hope and pretty sure that won't happen but I just it's that uncertainty we know the very least about how things are going to happen in gameweek one we we have preseason to go on but how reliable is that um so that just makes me a little bit nervous and obviously your relationship with the bench boost he's he's very strong as so you know maybe you're the one to advise on get out of the way get out the way it's like I said to you last time though it's it is horrible not having it and knowing that other people around you have it and that is enough for me not to play it game week one because there's just this constant threat that someone's going to hit like 30 40 points and you even when you're chasing in mini league you see people with the Chip And you think even though I'm ahead they might still catch up you know by x amount and I just I didn't I didn't like playing it early last last time so it's not for me n you ever played the bench boost early by accident or on or purpose I really thought you were gonna ask have you ever played it by accident no he has no um I did I had been weighing up playing it game week one just to get rid of it but you just it's so difficult to build a a team for the first five weeks of the back off a bench boost you just feel like you're making you you feel like you're really committing to picks that you don't really want to so I've abandoned that idea yeah I don't hate it though like if if you do manage to get a decent if you get the 15 out and they all play and both Mark and I have already predicted this to be a high-scoring week so you could you know if that's where your Murphy comes in and I don't know your dect and your zenos and all these you know Simas as well at left back maybe it's a master stroke but yeah not for not for me um anen says see you at fest tomorrow looking forward to seeing you see you there yes and seeing you in the flesh Nigel of course don't know what state I'll be in Yan but I'll be there uh Ross says I'm two hours 45 behind think I'll catch up on the rest tomorrow don't play you at all and Cameron says in Arizon with my two toddlers you guys have somehow been keeping them calm all afternoon what does that say about the three of us that we're so boring that it's [Music] keeping you know like when they're in like the Mindless trance watching like Bluey and there's just nothing behind the eyes I imagine that's uh that's probably quite similar and the final Super Chat of the night is from Davy's family first uh thank you so much I know you've been here for for a while DAV appreciate all support need a four five Defender have Salah Trent jotter Robinson and Hall who would you go for Nigel who's the four five uh against my better judgment I'd probably say Anderson even though there's some transfer rumors about him isn't there going to film I think he's a better pick at FM actually because I think that he will I think he'll he'll make a difference to that team but um yes so probably Anderson I I'm on the fense about coner and you know if there wasn't so much rumors around gay I'd say he's not a bad picker either but yeah probably Sayers I know you're gonna say Mark so any point it's coner or qua I've just realized n you could have been talking about cono earlier and I was talking about quono because it's so similar but those are the two aren't they those two at 4 five for me I mean coner of Aston Villa is the sensible pick because he'll get you that run you know you can then rotate him with Robinson over that run I don't know who your other Defender is you've got Trent Robinson and Hall you're not going to play Lewis Hall very often after game week one I wouldn't have fall so it depends who your other Defenders is and whether you've got to play Hall if you if you've got to play Hall then I would get coner because he gives you a better option over that run but I love I love jel quansa of Liverpool so so I would be tempted to double up but then do you want to be locked out of a third Liverpool player that's the other option but if you got Salah you've got probably all you need so I'm Tor I'm going to say Quant goel Quant yeah interesting I'm um I'm gonna say someone completely different and I'm gonna say vanen four five yeah for the early fixtures with Lester and Everton yeah just just go just go for the early the Early fixtures um I don't like coner do you know I was I had coner in one of my early drafts and I watched the um the planet FPL V with the Villa correspondent and James pointed out that coner played most minutes last season for Villa and got 91 points and I thought that is that is crap and they've now lost Louise I know the fixtures are great but I don't know I think you get you get a bit of attacking potential with with vaner in those first two games uh and good fixtures so he would be my pick can't have quer anyway there you go yeah that was that was I think they talking about himself rather than the super chat but yeah that that's the thing about quo he does lock out the Liverpool slot and you just don't know do you whether J keeps his place and you want to double up on Salah and J so that's the thing um it does shut that out and it is a bit of a worry for me yeah no disaster on Wheels I did not take a third pick out of nowhere it said the best four five Defender and I said vaner there wasn't options there was just just that question they're very strict with you aren't they you obviously have taken the Mickey a bit in your I do I give it yeah I give a lot so it's it's kind of it's only right um guys that is it we are cleared for super chats we've done 3 hours and 35 minutes Nigel you have been honestly I I knew you'd be good on here but I wasn't quite ready for how much brought to the stream you've done any of this business before Nigel have you been on other people's streams before no not at all well there we go we're gonna where's the contract get geted immediately let anyone else have it absolute absolute natural we'll we get the contract in the post Nigel you're not going anywhere we're going to lock

good evening everybody Welcome to fpl blackbox the second to last blackbox I believe until the season starts I'm with Mr Mark Southerns as always how are you Mark how you feeling yeah it's getting real it's getting real now isn't it it's uh very close to kickoff now so yeah I'm uh yeah looking forward to it Championship kicked off this weekend of course which is always the sign we're nearly there and looking forward to Fest Friday and uh yeah those last minute Tinkers that we're going to be doing I'm sure you have you got actually I didn't ask you for a team have you put a new team I've I've put a new team in but it's I'm at that stage where I thought I was pretty settled and then you make one or two little changes and then you end up changing like four or five players and honestly I could end up with anyone on on Friday the way the way things going I'm glad the um the preseason like nearly done now because that has been massively impacting my my selections more more so than other years which is was probably already too much did you uh by any chance see some of today's results I did indeed and that has massively affected of some of my same here same here I think it's difficult not to we're gonna talk about that we're gonna talk about Liverpool monks other teams could touch on some tactics from them and Arsenal and Brighton um where going to talk about the enablers because I think they've got a role to play in our thinking going into game week one uh and I posted some stuff on X about that I call it X now I've converted to X you know if you search for Twitter now on the iPhone it doesn't even show up you have to search it's now properly properly changed um well also I've done some work on um uh people saying I'm too loud so I'll bring myself down a little bit whoa that's a first can't um I've done I've done a bit of research on players that skew towards home games and players that could be flat track bullies as well so we're going to look at some data on that which is quite interesting and it might again feed into some of our decisions particularly the flat track bully um data that I've Unearthed some surprising results in there for sure um so yeah and I I thought I want to start really by looking at wild cards and when we play them but first of all I think it's time for a message from our sponsors right yes and it is the uh the the original the OG of our sponsors this time it's manscape today are back this season big supporters of of blackbox I think the the first sponsor or do we have maybe it was Nord first definitely one of the earliest ones yeah yes indeed we had obviously Mark and I big fans of manscape for anyone who's new to the channel you'll know of our love for manscaped and all of the uh different products you can see there's a new performance package out the 5.0 that's your nose and ear trimmer your bull shaver Dad I know you is Chris clear what it is now Chris is obviously has his dad is is he clear what it's for and what what's involved right also I should probably explain that to the to the viewers that that when we first did it my mom had to explain what a ball shaver was to my dad and I can only imagine the look of confusion and horror on his face as he heard me heard me talk about it I think he's now aware you know he's he's coming into the modern era now he's he's learning about about these things probably a bit late do you see do you see bull Shavers as the dawning of a modern era then is that what you're saying I think they are aren't they I think that's when I think that's when things started to change a bit in society when when the bull Shavers you know became a mainstream product um and manscapes are the top of the line for ball Shavers and everything else and also they now do a scalp buffer have you seen that this is for your head I hope this this this is for your head so if you're in the shower you want to give yourself a little scalp massage the manscaped have now got the scalp puffer uh to to do that and it's it's got things like it's antibacterial it's supposed to give your hair like the best clean possible so if you're in the market for something a bit new I've actually got the one it's like a little um silicone thing that you use on your arms and it's supposed to like get your paws and and things out I've got the man you seen the benefits of that you're getting quite sweaty as we near a deadline yeah it's hot and it's hot today it's like 278 need it with the the deadline approaching so yeah um head over to manscape there's 20% off sale on site for whatever reason that site ends you can always use R code blackbox in fact use our code anyway delete the the SP know the the summer sale one use the code blackbox support the channel and yeah sort out all your mail grooming needs thank you very much well done as another great delivery um let's get on to Fantasy content shall we um right uh fixture ticker I just bring this up just a reminder I've done some work on this U put some custom values in the fancy Football Scout to we should say of course all the data from tonight's show comes from fancy Football Scout our friends there thank you for the back in with that and this is their fixture ticker um Liverpool who of course are quite a Hot Topic after tonight today's against sever of course um jotto and Diaz we're going to talk about throughout the show I'm sure um they're right the top of the fix ticker Fulham then Villa this is from game weeks one to six of course um and then you go down the bottom you look at likes of wolves very tough start to the season brenford and and even city um not the easiest start with Chelsea Arsenal Newcastle in the first six of course um but that's not going to put us off a certain Striker I'm sure um but what I want to do rather than go and dwell on the ticker too much is uh look at Lego man's um Hop On Hop Off graphic this is a stapler the show we of I love it often use this um you'll see it in a lot of other streams as well what this does it it basically looks at where you should be getting on and off teams uh up to gameweek 19 because of course gameweek 19 is when the second wild card comes in uh and I've put some bold lines on this to demonstrate where the international breaks are so the international breaks come between game weeks three and four between seven and eight and 11 and 12 and the reason I've done that is because the international brakes are often the most obvious areas to use the wild card um and the where you're using the wild card I guess can to some extent Shake what we go into in game week one because obviously if you're going to use the Wild Card between up to game week four you don't need to look at the ticker Beyond gameweek four when you're looking at your players because you're going to refresh it between three and four I just want to ask you as have you had any thought about this yet have you have you looked at this and thought well I'm going to play it there or I'm going to play it here or are you going into the season and playing it by ear what you doing well I saw your post about potentially playing it in game week three or or game week four four and I mean you look at the this and you see Liverpool with a hop on of of all four games not Forest Bournemouth ws and and Palace Chelsea as well Bournemouth West Ham Brighton and Forest I guess my question is if I start the season with two Liverpool players like I've kind of already got at the moment as as a bit spoiler and I start with enu who has a bit of a spoiler is also in my in my team um is there a need to if they're going to be the teams that we're hopping on so to speak is is there a real need to when I've already got those those three Palmer's the one obviously who who could be the also if I haven't got Salah as another spoiler and uh and he suddenly and he starts really strongly is that going to be the time to then then jump off him so I think it's it's obviously dependent on what kind of happens and how my team's performing but I do quite like the idea of trying to get to three or four banking the transfers while carding and really attacking when we know a bit more about your foden your Palmer all of these you know we're gonna have a full spread of Premium assets to pick from you walk out into that and then you've still got the four or four transfers to then things I TW it's a strong start to the season isn't it I I tweeted about this I think that is wholly unrealistic right because I think the period where you're least likely to save transfers and the period where it's warranted to spend transfers is early on Because unless we get everything right game week one we're going to look at enablers later on someone's one or more players are going to break out in the first couple of game weeks and do you really think you're going to sit there and go no I'm not going to use transfers I'm going to because I'm going a wild card between three and four so I'm going to let these players go I'll let the Rises go others can get on them for n one or even n two cheaper but I'll get them in the Wild Card do you really think you're going to do that it's it's the it's the toss-ups isn't it like M darell mysterious darell in the chat says obviously price rise is a key so you don't want to be we know that almost a 0.1 is almost like a 0. five r at this stage because it might mean you can't move for the for the player that you want I completely get that um but also I think it might make me a little bit less maybe a bit less um knee- jerky on on some players to try and get through I just think building up a pool of transfers of around two or three at the start of the season I just can't help but feel that's going to put you in such good stead we're going to be wild carding around like no later than what came week seven well can't see us going any later than that well in a minute we'll look at that I'm I'm going to show you some pros and cons of where to play the wild card and we'll discuss it a bit more but I just think that it's going to be really difficult to sit on our hands if we say right we're going to play it between three and four and I'm going to save my transfers going into gameweek two and save my transfer going into gameweek three and then come out of the wild card with two extra transfers basically yeah that's a lovely idea and I don't dispute that's going to put you in a great position but only if yeah there's no you only if with the wild card that's quick enough to react to the early bandwagons and I think there were cin to play in the wild card in in gameweek three between gameweek three and four between game three and four we have hardly any data we have three game weeks of data to go on yeah and I think but I think the interesting thing is the bandwagons as we're going to talk about in this stream are going to be the 55s and the fives that that's where that's where I think that is going to emerge as the five five or or maybe a 4.5 defender or something like that so I guess you have to weigh up do you want to wait a bit and see if that kind of carries on or say Smith row scores in game we one and then goes into Leicester at home he could rise point two yes that's my point it for those who who aren't wild for those who don't commit to the wild card three and four like I don't think I'm going to I'm not going to think twice about using a transfer after gameweek one and one between gameweek two and three if there's a player who blows up and I think they're a long-term Prospect which is hard to assess then I want to move I don't want to I don't want a wild card and have to pay nor two more why why do I want to do that but the three and four option do you not think the data we've got into we've got fre game weeks data we have no information on the impact of European fixures because they don't start until gameweek after game week four so we have no idea you know as to whether the the teams in the Champions League in particular City Arsenal Villa and Liverpool we have no idea how the Champions League fixures are going to start affecting their league um lineups and X-Men because there could be some impact I'm thinking certainly City's defense for example with vardal we just don't know if he is he going to play every European game and every League game you know he's probably going to heighten his chances of of of some rest in in the Premier League so we don't have any data on that we only have three game weeks data in terms of the OPA data for this show and in the members areas and so on and also the transfer window activity it hasn't settled down so the transfer window is the 31st of of August G week four is the 14th of September we haven't had time at that point to see how the new players coming in are going to change the X-Men of the players that we know so we have none we have no information on that either so I think three and four is not the best I mean there are good reasons to play it as you see here um you can do early fixes you get maximum benefit in terms of the span of game weeks you get you obviously get game weeks four to 19 with the wild card and the benefits of it and there's positive fixture swings like you said and you can move for the bandwagons but lack of data and lack of information after the transfer window and no input you I think they're negatives what do you reckon well don't don't get me wrong I'm not saying that I'm going to Wild Card in game week four or that I think it's the best policy but I think if if you can get to my my point is when I when I when I wild card I want to have some free transfers banked and I'm not I've never been good at that in the past you know yeah so I I want to make a more conscious effort this season to try and get through to the world card and have two or three transfers coming out of that right as as well so I mean the advantage like you just said is of playing in game four and like I said is the is having those premiums back you can you could take out Harland for example and you could if you think okay let's go sacka Watkins Palmer even foden like you could probably have four premiums for example and they're all going to be back and fit and getting on those early and then if you can use the two or three transfers to rotate those around for however long till I don't yeah I agree that could that could that is going to be what some people do and it could be really effective but I do agree the sensal plate is obviously to wait until game we gate and have more information because the wild card's so important and because we've got more information going into it but it is like the it is the high risk High reward play isn't it of going early trying to tap into the the big names who are all back and then just hoping that they just Blitz all the Harland and Salah teams with like the Smith RADS and the m and the 4.5 vendors and really just spread that money around yeah but the thing is I think if you get if you if you book in the wild card for game at three and four I think you're less likely to make transfers in game weeks one and two and I think that could be to your detriment I think that you're going to miss a few things and I think I'd rather look at game week eight or even game week 12 because there's much more data available you you get you get to see the impact of the transfer window on X minutes expected minutes that is and you get to see how European fixtures might affect things for the for the top Champions League teams in particular uh and I think it's easier to save transfers once we get to game weeks five six and seven then it is to save them in game weeks one and two and three because in game weeks two and three the the the market is really volatile prices are rising heav really quickly and maybe in game weeks five six and seven less so you don't know unless we're four million in the world again Mark and then it's minus get us it yeah we're not planning for that kind of start but I I I do think game week eight is better I think in terms of data gameweek 12 is even better obviously because we've got at that point we've got what we would consider perhaps a useful sample of data it's only 11 game weeks of data but it's still better than having free of course um but it is gameweek 12 too late because obviously then the benefits are you've only got up to gameweek 19 before the second wild card is available um the benefits of game 12 low is that you can use it to save transfers over the Christmas period because if you think you play it in gameweek 12 and you take some transfers into that as well maybe you rolled a couple of transfers over so you come out of game we you go into gameweek 12 with wild card team and a couple of transfers in the bank it means you're set up nicely for Christmas because that's as we know fixtures are quite squeezed there games come thicker and faster so that that's a little benefit maybe along with the the extra data I'm not going in not picking my gameweek one lineup with any week for my wild card in mind at the moment what about yourself no definitely not no I think it's it is I am picking it in the sense I'm I'm looking at shortterm fixtures you know with with a mind but the shortterm is probably like four four or five game weeks rather than looking at specifically three targeting three and then it was a consideration I did look at literally just building my team for three weeks and then seeing how it was but I want to give myself the option to delay it if I can because obviously you don't want to force yourself into a world card at this stage do you I mean the other option and someone's put out in the chat is and I heard James plan FPL correspond we talking about the bench boost in game week one well if you're bench boosting in game week one then you probably are locking yourself into an early wild card right because you want to use some of those funds you probably spread around um you know in other places yeah so yeah he he seems set on that and it be inter to see if he if he goes through it he did last year so see if he does again yeah I I I think though that um going into game week one how much do we actually know um we don't really we obviously don't have any any recent data to go on at all and there's every chance there there's some outliers in the team sheets that we just didn't expect that's the only thing that put it makes me feel nervous just thinking about think about it yeah but I yeah certainly anyone bench booting yeah you're right is signing up for a gameweek three to four wild card for absolutely absolutely very B with with that you're never going to live that down are you as never going to live that down for the podcast says as if you use a bench boost and G one then you can't use it by accident yeah thanks Bobby thanks for the reminder got Point got a point um over a thousand watching already on a Sunday evening 8 o' which is um fantastic amazing oh hello hello joining us oh I will I will just do a a quick shout for the the black boox League um as you can see scrolling down the bottom new code for that we want to be top top again like we were that that one year don't let the let's talks and everyone join us the code is H 81 L8 right uh I'm going to talk about some other aspects now um I'm going to look at home returns so I thought what I do is slice the data that we've got in the members area in the Scout members area to look at players who have a bias or did have a bias in their data towards playing at home and those who had a bias against playing against the bottom six versus playing away and playing the top eight and when I say the top eight it's the big six and I included Villa and uh Newcastle in I think it was Newcastle can't it was the team up I think it was yeah so i i i p I picked eight teams that I considered the top six or top eight teams and then the bottom six obviously the three relegated teams and then the three above them from last season so that's that's the pool of teams that I use for this analysis Home and Away data first though um this is extraordinary we kind of felt it throughout the season Anthony Gordon and you can see 22 returns in 18 starts at home and then you look at cross the table only five returns in 16 starts away I mean I've not seen that before a player so skewed that much to a home game to a home game I I don't I mean I don't know what the factors were but there it is clear right yeah I mean you look at the other players who who had the big returns in home games Palmer Watkins obviously Harland I mean I know well Palmer wasn't Elite asset until until last season you could almost say Palmer and Gordon joined similar I don't think anyone was expecting either of them to have the season that that they went on and had but yeah Gord with with 16 starts away five returns and Palmer with 16 starts away and 15 returns so even though Palmer got more returns at home he still wasn't that he was still amazing away from home yeah me I just I I just don't I mean we asked I remember asking Luke about it last season and he's it's just variance isn't it it's variance it'll catch up to eventually will it we didn't happen last it what is that I've never seen anything anything like that we've always had we've had players who we know have been better at home than up than than away but never to this extent I mean look at Palmer as well um in the 13 starts he only blanked in one start yeah so he returned in 12 or 13 starts at home um Salah only blanked in three of 15 home STS as well like incredibly strong at anfield um so that that even beat harand who blanked in five of his 15 starts I mean it is the big names the big fancy assets Watkins Harland sellah Palmer these are the players that obviously at the very top of the total points column had the most returns in home games really did exploit it the outlier here is is is Bailey 16 again 16 home returns but only five away returns so 16 home returns in 13 starts but only five returns away from home in 16 starts um sorry in nine starts so you know he was much more effective at Villa Park mateta as well uh and we're going to look at this in terms of xgi on penalty later and we see the real difference there in in those two players sacka is really Balan low 13 returns at home 16 away no no difference there really join most double digit returns away well fora yeah five double digit returns and five at home as well so um a real or four at home rather real real rounder there so we can be reassured with with the uh with the sacka selection um E will'll look at later as well very strong at 10 Returns in in 12 starts um compared to six in 12 away from home um looking at away returns next um Watkins harand sacka parason Salah again the big names all at the top salanki is someone we've got to talk about um did well away from home 12 returns two double digit returns as well um and they came um in 16 starts and at home for him 19 starts at home and um and 10 Returns so an all rounder like sacka really um what Jamaica is a slanky situation by the way I mean gone to Spurs officially yeah andie's giving all the positive signs that he's starting is that one of the factors that's made you look at your lineup last couple of days absolutely absolutely I don't think we can be be sleeping on on Dom not when it's Lester and Everton in the first two games for Spurs um not with RIS and Betty I don't think he has featured as a pre preseason um and I think that the worry was was Kulu and how well kulu's been playing and then po pooku come out and said he doesn't want to play him there and he sees him much more as a wide player or or a 10 so I can't see any way that sanki doesn't go straight in in in that first game against Leicester and Leicester look awful season they don't look ready at all to for the Premier League let alone with with a pointed aution that's probably going to hit them um at the same time so I'm just looking at all those things and thinking I really don't want to be going out without without sankin actually my my squad has changed because I look at Spurs and think those first two games I want to make sure I've got the two best assets from what I believe from from that club and I think the two best are sankian and porro obviously son's a great option but he's a lot price yet yeah and um yeah I think obviously slank has now gone up a level at spurs in terms of his appeal to Fantasy manager he was always the Talisman at bourou and maybe he won't be the Talisman at Spurs but I don't think that reduce his appeal um it'd be interesting to see if he gets penalties he should do should yeah you think he would wouldn't you I was talking to Sam about it the the other day and she said she's never really felt son kind of really wanted them he kind of was good at them and and you know when Kane wasn't taking them he kind of stepped up but San's got a very very good record at penalties and I I I think he'll I think he'll take him personally okay let's get back I'm sure we touched on slanking a bit later this is a returns against the bottom six compared to the top eight again this is at the top of all of these charts isn't it look at the balance here though 15 returns in 12 starts against the bottom six yeah compared to six returns in 13 starts against the top eight so if you want the definition of a flat track bully it's Watkins now that that I didn't really perceive that throughout the season it never really came across did it because he he seemed to be very consistent no matter what but clearly he absolutely punishes the bottom sides and that's important when you look at the fixture swing that's coming as way after the first couple of game weeks because they do have they do have a very very attractive um swing after yeah Leicester Everton walls its witch so when we go back to when we go back to that for Watkins given that he was the major flat track bully of last season does it mean that we've got to go into gameweek one really trying to set up so that we can move to Watkins in gameweek three well I mean I was very impressed with bayy stats on on the first the first screen that you showed and obviously there's that question mark around coverage but with diby not there now I think Bailey is a very good option in his own right and he's going to be much easier um for people to get to but one of the good things about maybe going with Salan is you haven't got to move up potentially so much from like a Jal Pedro or an Armstrong or a moon is that a lot of people are gonna have to turn that spot into something else you know you you could go down a couple like that's a Salah to sacka potentially and then salanki up to to Watkins if I got that's right around that you know give or take the point ones and point twos that going happen um so that's another reason because I think that the strikers are are strong and with with isach and Harland and Watkins they they are and with salanki they're going to be four prominent players for us all season for sure and then that's not including because I think J Pedro is going to go on and have an absolutely brilliant season for us um you know if he gets the game time I think mun has got such a good run of fixtures like going forward the strikers suddenly look a lot more attractive um you know Tony might come back into the if if he stays at brenford lots of good options there so that's how I've tried to set my team up is to be able to move around those a little bit easier rather than restrict myself to one of the okay interesting I mean and again we're going to look at Midfield enablers later the fact that there are now an array of attractive forwards that are are kind of easier to predict in terms of output I would say makes me think that perhaps it makes those neighbors really attractive because obviously you can clear money out in Midfield Midfield I know is the engine of our fancy teams but when there's obvious Bargains there and then obvious Topline Strikers to go for up up top maybe is three up top and a cheaper Midfield is a way to go and yeah yeah maybe it is um I want to point out isak here as well look at this eight goals in six starts against the bottom six yeah I mean that's ridic 11 returns in six starts and I think it's I think it's one of the reasons why I've I've I didn't have Salah then I had Salah and I've taken him out because I keep coming back to that captaincy in game week one and I just keep thinking isack at home to Southampton that is just there's goals in that for him maybe Salah does outscore him away IP switch obviously that's a great fixture but isack could get a hat-trick in that game and I don't think anyone would be that surprised and then you look at records like this and think yeah he's he's more than capable of doing that so having that captaincy option that week maybe means that you can you can avoid seller um going forward potenti he was absolutely sparkling in preseason in the last preseason game and and when you look at the previous table and gon being that Homer that he was he so strong at home and then you look at isach and the flat track buly and you look at isach and gon against Southampton at home and you think well is it is it is there any need to think about that I guess there there's some question marks about Golden's minutes he's still in my team at the moment I think he will start personally that might in the end tip me away from him but at the moment I look at Gordon and isach and I look at this data and think Goldman was strong at home maybe it was just variance but I'm I'm pretty confident going into the game that he will be a a key figure for them against sthampton and isaach was a huge flat track bully as we see here those two players it's very hard to look away from them isn't it for game we one with this in mind yeah where where's Gordon he's he's about yeah this yeah he quite High yeah but I mean I'm talking about the home form for Gordon and obviously a home fixture against a top a likely bottom sck side so therefore on both variables goldon and is are very attractive I think the the issue with obviously very attractive for gameweek one and in game week three it's a home game against Spurs but then it's three away games uh you know gave me two four and five so has he got the same because i' I've had Gordon in in loads of drafts I've been looking at him but I think he probably starts game week one but I'm a little bit worried about it and I'm a little bit worried that his constant Liverpool transfer news going on it's the same with e as well there's the like Man City Links isn't there like could knocking yeah I don't think either one of them is gonna happen I don't really know why I think Liverpool would have to sell Diaz and then move for Gordon and pay 70 million or whatever I don't think it's gonna with City and E they're gonna probably to pay about 80 million for him I don't see it but it could it could happen and Trent as well Trent's another one last year of his contract um I was assing again I'm going to keep mention the planet FPL correspondence week if you you haven't listened to that being one was really good I don't know who that that one was that one was the odd one out but the rest they W but yeah the Liverpool correspondent was worried about about Trent it's it's I think it's van djk uh Trent and um there's another one in the last year of the contract Salah obviously Salah um so what's going on there with with how long that's taken is that are they all three of those are going to get over the line of the next few weeks you know it's Unthinkable to think that Trent could be sold but if he goes into this without a contract Is it feasible that someone comes in with bid I don't think he I don't think he will go I think Gordon and E there'll be rumors right up to deadline day and that's what I mean about you know if you sit here now and go no I'm going to play the Wild Card between game weeks three and four and then both e both e and golden move before gameweek four what you're GNA play the wild card without knowing how golden and E are going to disrupt things at Spurs and Liverpool I mean that could happen and then youve you've committed to the wild C guard and then you've got to play it without knowledge of how that's going to impact Liverpool and how that's going to impact Spurs so that's what I was talking about about you know really booking it in now and going right I'm gon to build a team for gameweek one with wild card gameweek four in mind the transfer window there's all kinds of things that can happen and absolutely and there's big names being mentioned that could really disrupt things yeah I completely agree and and just for the record I don't think Trent is gonna go anywhere I think I think all I think all three will sign a new contract probably this week before before the new season starts and I I don't think e and Gordon are going to go either but it is still a bit of a concern isn't it when you're picking players who have that kind of hanging over them like you say if you are if you are building for that wild card and then suddenly you've got an e going to Palace um e going to city or Spurs or whoever you don't want them anymore because you need to give them a bit of time to see how they're gonna they're going to fit into that talking of eay um seven returns in nine starts against the bottom six and then you look across um and it's uh it's six for returns in 11 starts against the top eight so another yeah another player who looks on this evidence as as being a flat track bully last season and that's worth bearing in mind with with palace's run that does get Kinder after a spell Andreas as well you know Andreas Pereira of course he's a player that you know the algorithm likes on penalties for Fulham there there is some transfer rumor about him as well so that's something bear in mind but look at that seven returns and 11 starts against the bottom six all assists just one return in 15 starts against the top eight so there's no question there that if you are looking at Pereira in this run that Fulham have got and it's very favorable there is some logic behind that based on what we saw last season he does return against the bottom play sides as you would you it's probably logical that that is the case but these extreme swings are just worth noting and of course there's no we're not suggesting it's going to it's going to remain the case for for this season but it's just interesting to look back and we we could we could could potentially judge Smith row on that on that yard stick so if perea does leave and Smith row is playing in that 10 role in and around the same areas then you would expect him to get similar chances and and probably kick on and do well I mean those those six games for Fulham or however is five or six games are just they're ridiculous really yeah I mean I think what I've seen preseason Smith Rose in the 10 very close to Rodrigo and Andreas is is a bit further back but they are trying they are trying to sign another defensive midfielder and Andreas there's a lot of speculation about his future as well which puts me off him really he's another one that could lightly go returns against the top teams um son really stands out um he's he's got six returns in 11 starts against the bottom six but 13 returns in 13 starts against the top eight eight goals and five assists then for some against the top eight which suggest that you know on last season's showing he was absolutely fixture proof and it's interesting you look at the names at the top of it it's all the really strong players that that still deliver against the top eight son Harland gon Salah Palmer boen sacka have Salan don't miss off mata mata is there as well I know I know but he's not a consideration for game rout one is he um but the these are players that show their quality here when you look at how they fared against the top teams there's no concern with harand then um you know along with goldon and Salah that he can return against the top teams as well as as the the bottom teams and when we look at XG data in a minute he actually his xgi non- penalty goes down a little bit against the bottom six um compared to against the top eight which is extraordinary isn't it so his xgi is actually stronger against the top eight teams than it is against the bottom six last season so absolutely no fear that there fixtures are concern for the likes of him and Salah and so on yeah I mean where's e on this on this list I mean I know he he obviously missed minutes last season because of injury but I mean there's players like Nunez on there J Pedro he missed large parts of the season um for injury you know Jackson was kind of in and out the team elanga like I would expect to see e still scoring quite well against the top sides well e e got six returns in 11 starts yeah okay against the top eight not hideous so he did dip so he just he's just off he's just off just off the table you interesting Gibbs white in in a similar bracket he only got three returns against the bottom six in eight starts against the bottom six three returns and yet against the top eight in how many starts was it it was you know 16 starts he got seven returns so again a quality player who can return against tougher teams as well um and and no evidence that he's a flat track bully as such um yeah I mean it's um and I thought I'd just look at the Heavy Hitters in particular so har and sacka Salah and son here um and now we're starting to look at the xgi data and how that's affected and it is interesting when you look at salah's xgi non penalty per 90 against the bottom six it's 0.98 and that drops to 0.76 against the top eight as you would expect you know Liverpool perhaps creating fewer chances but then when you look at Harland it's like it's like I said Harland against the bottom six 0.85 and against the top eight 0.89 it actually goes up against the top eight so that absolutely no difference at all um yeah maybe that says something about Man City and the way they play they don't you know they they're full tilt against all teams perhaps but Salah is affected by the quality of the opposition in terms of XG on penalty but Harland isn't which is quite interesting and sacka is really steady as well 0.54 against the bottom six 0.51 against the top eight so really only Salah the one that's changing the points per 90 all differs and that's what you would probably expect but the xgi the only one that really stands out there is the difference in Salah the other three of the heavy is very very steady regardless of the quality of the opponent in terms of xgi and I think this is important because I think we're going to see more of the upside chasing type behavior that we have you know I mean we've all done it in the past you know sing out a Salah for a sacka who's got a better fixture isn't um you know isn't you know don't need a massive brain to to know that's probably a good move but at the same time you know know knowing when to move on like son for example if you've got son in a difficult away game it might not always be prudent to move him to a sacka and maybe use that transfer elsewhere because of how good he is returning in in those games so I think you need to have a good understanding of of which players you know do this and I think Harland for example isn't going to be someone who you just want to make a like for like swap for because he can always turn up in in the game and and score a couple of goals you'll need to use a couple of transfers to really make the most of it and try and strengthen elsewhere if you're taking him out um because that that's the thing I think is going to be the most fascinating about this season is is what people do when they take a cell out and they've got a few transfers to make because it's going to be like three or four changes being made for on across different teams it's gonna be whole squads being ripped up when fixture changes happen to accommodate lots of different players and we haven't really seen that before because minus eights and minus 12 are so rare whereas they well potentially could be less rare if there's more more of being saved yeah no I mean it it has made it fascinating just you know the impact of the pricing is considerable so then I thought I'd look at um XG non penalty per 90 and track the players that have the biggest bias in terms of playing against the bottom six versus playing against the top eight so in other words what you're seeing here is the players were have the biggest increase in XG on penalty against the bottom six compared to the top eight and so in other words Raheem Sterling Brennan Johnson are right at the top here so Raheem Sterling's EXT y on penalty jumps by 0.61 when he plays the bottom six compared to the top eight so in other words in terms of xgi he's a huge flat track bully put him in tough games and he's he's awful but yeah yeah Brennan Johnson's next though .6 and that's key isn't it because you you're talking about Spurs and how you cash in on them they going to Leicester and Everton who I think Lester and Everton are two teams that probably will be in the bottom six or can be considered candidates for the bottom six Brenan Johnson last season his exj on penal against the bottom six teams jumped by 0.60 that's a huge jump so Brenan Johnson if you think he can start and he may not do with kesi maybe not playing up front maybe but I think he will Brennan's Pace will mean he'll start both games I think I think Brennan's a very good option for those first two at 65 got off him because of the thing I don't think Kudo is gonna suddenly be pushed wide he might play 10 but Madison then he might do yeah madon Madison has been has been poor but that would be quite a big big change I just don't see I just I just don't he's played there all preseason and I think the pace is important to them on the flanks um and I think the service that salanki can get from Johnson is a different kind of service than the one could kesi might be better against a low block but again in the leester so Everton maybe but Leicester Brenham starts I would have said and I think he would start the EV game Sterling and Johnson right out front here Palmer's interesting so yeah he's definitely a flat track biased player in terms of XG on penalty Bas last season his XG on penalty jumped by 0.40 against the bottom six compared to the top eight and eay there look at the jump of e 0.39 so again Palmer and eza based on what we saw last season are players that significantly improve in terms of xgi when they're playing the bottom side what's interesting here is harland's nowhere near this like I said his xgi is steady and actually increases against the top eight over the bottom six so he's not affected by it but all these players are isak's up there 0.35 flat track bully as we mentioned and J and Diaz look at them now we talk about going into the itswitch game it switch obviously another candidate for the bottom six last season against the bottom six Jos and Diaz his Exon on penalty increased by n 30 so a very real increase in the expected goals expected assists that those two players got against the top six now you you probably expect it they're quality players in a quality team but I said Harland doesn't get that so going into the IT game if you're considering jto and Diaz the evidence of last season backs that up yeah I mean I guess the caveat to that is that Salah XG is so high that the difference is negligible which is why he's not on this on this list so although it obviously is a positive for Jo and Diaz it's also a positive for Salah but he's not on it because you can just leave him throughout he's always be going to be living the same um yeah but absolutely and and I think you know not going with a Liverpool attacker seems risky I know it's difficult if you take seller out the equation to know who's going to start and I know there's going to be rotation there but from what I've seen and from what I've seen today I think it's pretty obvious that it's going to be Diaz jotter and Salah right as as as the front three yeah they start at it switch don't they they have to because they been brilliant all preseason Liverpool had that second game of preseason today nil nil Darwin scored but it was offside I don't know you J scored a first time volley from a Trent cross Diaz's got a brace it's that front free and I i' I think I've always said it that front free is to me is obviously the best front threee that Liverpool can put out um Darwin bring Off the Bench fine he can cause a bit of Carnage but he shouldn't be starting um gakpo had a good Euros but he hasn't really delivered for for Liverpool so a long rant but I think it's obviously going to be those three so I think you can pick one from from those three Diaz and jot are options for us yeah and we're gonna we're gonna I'm going to go back to the slot tactics after what we saw today with j and Diaz and I I'll put a case together as to why I think that there is appeel now on those two not just because of the output but because what we saw tactically from Liverpool and but I think this this also suggests that against it switch away based on what we saw last season we can expect good output from Diaz and jot in terms of xgi based on the patterns we saw last year if you can put any any stock in that at all um home bias now um don't know why mopay is so much more effective in terms of on penalty at home small sample of data I imagine joto is very interesting very much in terms of not only a player who skews to WS flat track in terms of his xgr increases against the bottom six but when at anfield his xgi increases significantly as well up by nor 44 now obviously the Swit game is not at anfield but that's worth bearing in mind as well I think that he's a player that we've consistently seen do well in our data but I always felt that Salah was the player who was Stronger at anfield and the skew towards home games are stronger in Salah but I didn't I didn't imagine it in J to the same degree but but there it is Salah 0.36 so you can see his xgi jumps massively when at anfield compared to when away from home and again harland's not affected by the so harand his ex John on penalty stays steady home or away Salah doesn't Salah jumps by .36 when playing at anfield and so does JS and that probably has something to do with the way Liverpool play at anfield and their dominance at anfield um but that's interested is that it's really strong the home bias for Liverpool for their attacking assets yeah I mean it's inter see what what slot's going to do with that because obviously we saw the the the lineup today and Liverpool obviously the great performance in that F how I've ever seen a team have two games in a day like that weird weird like pre-season thing one team in one and then another team in the other but salah's average position was really interesting because he was we were wondering how he'd be moved from how klopp was using him last year but it looks like he's even wider than he was under under Club but he's also pushed even higher than than he was um he's the high he's his his heat map compared to the others is so high well we're going to look at that now before we do I want to talk Bailey there as well because we talked about Bailey being look how strong he is at home 0.41 really skewed so now we see in the return numbers you see it in the XG as well so Bailey away from the radar isn't he massively I mentioned him last show and you weren't that no I've I've I heard a really good as Villa correspondent on planet who who said he was good and I trust him more than you so now I'm all in you said he was a mi player you said you didn't want to go there because he a player he is he is he is a you player um that is that is annoying because of how well he did for you last season was he five million last year yeah he's six5 this year I think that does put me off him I think there's lot of comp competition in that bracket but when Villa have got good home fixtures biley Comes Alive as this data shows or did last season anyway away yeah losing di is is massive obviously there's rumors with J Felix and there could be players that that come in but as it stands he hasn't really got any competition on on the right hand side so you've got got to think he's a he's a good pick and Rogers has got a lot of competition you know there's there'sa there if fedix comes in that's probably going to be Rogers that misses out but then he is verse me he started up front in the last last game he can play in the 10 he can play on the left It's Tricky It's Tricky between them but yeah I have I must admit I have I have come around to to Bailey I I actually think out of the six fives he's probably my top my top three right I mean certainly from game meet three onward when the swing comes and you know the I mean let's have a look at the ticker again I'm not sure at the fixtures Villa got so yeah they've got Everton and wolves right they're the home games in that spell so getting Bailey in for Ev and wolves again two teams that you would think would be in the mix for the bottom six yeah Bailey as we saw in this data incredibly strong at home and decent against bottom six sides Bailey's got to be an option yeah um okay I want to look at slots tactic I'm going to come back to Neighbors in a minute but as you've mentioned where salah's been playing this is what I saw today from the from the lineup and from the um average positions um it was Becker and goal obviously Trent came in at right back rather than Midfield role quansa kept the role alongside van djk which is what I expected which makes him a really good option at four five simic has got the left back spot at the moment Y and both simic and Trent pushing inside to almost defensive Midfield positions along alongside grab mallister not really in a defensive position but pushing forward from left side of Midfield and saos on the right side of Midfield and why that's important is so bosly was the furest forward and because he's right side and because Trent is right side I think those two are the factors that are pushing Salah wider because Trent and sabosa are running the inside track which means Salah can't come inside as much or won't because he's occupying the same space and Salah will therefore then stay wider and run run High which is what the the chart shows here jot coming deeper and almost alongside saos line a lot in terms of average position and it was Diaz Who was the player cutting inside centrally most of all the players and if we look at the heat Maps here one is Salah one is Diaz and you can see it look at the the amount of touches that Salah had wide yes he had some really good touches around the edge of the box as well but Diaz in terms of average position and touches slightly more Central so he was more inclined to come inside than Salah and I think it's the BOS and Trent that side that is the factor behind it if you look at Trent 66 sosla 8 and jotter 20 look at that cluster there look how close they are and they're all goingon to obviously pour forward as well I think with with Diaz he's got Simas and he's got Maller who aren't as attacking and forward thinking as Trent and sosli so I think Diaz will get more opportunity come inside where Salah will stay wider on the evidence of one match I mean and and and data for but it's interesting isn't it I think the the issue is is that Diaz has had what two seasons now season and a half any time in in in January and he's not a clinical finisher is he that isn't he's he's obious incredibly no League of Salah but he has he is good from range cutting inside when he comes Central but what what would you what would you say his what would you say his potential is in terms of goals and assists I mean he's he doesn't strike me as a 20 goal involvement player no I mean he'd have to massively improve on a lot of aspects I mean you compare him to man for example who had a similar role man was just a different Beast altogether um so it's a big ask for a player like that to suddenly turn into a a goal scorer and take some of that yeah but you're talking about season long I don't I'm not I wouldn't get Diaz season long I'd get him for three or four game weeks yeah and and in the three or four game weeks they've got it s brenford United and Forest but he's the same price as jot would you back him would you back him as a better asset than J I mean the heat Maps wise J's dropping deep and you could argue Diaz is pushing forward more but if I'm picking one of the two I'm going jot every day because of that clinical nurse yeah no I I I think that I think Diaz's stock goes up because of this what what we saw today but we need more data obviously but it is interesting I mean and and there's a suggestion from this that sacka will be asked to be more of a a wide player he will still score goals Salah yeah sorry he will still he will still score goals he will still be their best asset and he'll still probably get 20 goals right I'm not saying that but we did wonder how slots tactics were going to influence things and if if Trent stays right back and sabosa stays he's number eight but he was playing as the 10 he was further forward than mallister from what I saw the average positions are very very close but you when you're looking at sub BOS mallister which one is more likely to raid the box I would say over the season it'll be sosl so again Salah has got the two players who are more likely to get into the box and attack on his side whereas Diaz has got mallister and and sim a lesser players and I would say less Forward Thinking so I just wonder whether that's going to be a factor that might that might Cil salah's position a little bit we'll have to see but it's interesting is yeah that is that is really interesting and it's going you know if Trent is on the and he's pinging balls over it's he still needs like when it was man it was that you know that was so easy was I think Diaz is being molded more into that into that role where they want him further up the pitch want him get getting closer to the goal um and that he might be able to do that with the options you know behind him but like I say it's difficult it's difficult to to know I I I still think I mean someone's mentioned in the chat um you know Tom said will jot to get injured in game week two and that is always a worry with him but given the preseason he's had given what we've seen um you know from him in in those games I I think he's he's a very very strong option and he's given us a choice between him and Salah now whereas I wasn't really considering it before today well I mean we what we wanted from these last friendlies was evidence to suggest what the opening gameweek one lineups would be and I think you said it earlier I think we more or less know now that Diaz Salah and J will be the front three so when you know that and it's it switch away I know you should you know kneejerk and react on the basis of Diaz's one goal J's assist and one goal but it's not really about the output it's about the expected minutes now we now know that those three are very very likely to start together I would be I would be astounded if Nunes and GPO break into the starting 11 for IP switch so that's got to be a factor in our thinking now I think it has to be because you know I look at I look at fod and Harland and think um you know there's what five million difference between them um how much difference in points is is there is there going to be uh you know between them at the end and in a way I still think Harland should Blitz foden because I think Carlin getting what 24 goals last season that's almost the lowest he's going to get you know he could easily go on and hit 30 35 goals again this season and then he blitzes pH whereas I look at jotter and Salah and injuries obviously kind of completely Cil it but I think if J was starting every week and with Salah I don't I I think J would clear 200 points easy and you know it's his 5 million again between them yeah and I think that difference between them is less maybe than than some of the other coverage picks um but obviously it all depends on on Fitness and and whether he can keep that spot because if GPO starts coming in then it's it's ruined but we we know what jot is capable of he's the best the by my point and CLA says you know J's injury record yeah I agree but I'm not talking about this for the season I'm not even talking for 10 game weeks I'm talking about for three or four game weeks and again this goes back to why I think we shouldn't book in the Wild Card gameweek three and four and this is why I think we shouldn't be shy about using transfers because if you book in the wild card game with three and four you're likely to overlook J because you'll go I don't want jotter because basically I might have to transfer him out gameweek two and I want to store my transfers so I take transfers in after the wild card so the wild card is stopping you using transfers in game weeks two and three and stopping you getting jotter for the first two game weeks because you don't want to have the risk of having to transfer him out so don't think like that is my VI it's like don't look at jot as a short-term option that you might have to move out in gameweek two or game three but so what you can have him for it switch he could get a hattick at it switch easily yeah yeah because he's playing up front for Liverpool at and we don't know what we're gonna get from it switch this is what I mean e either of them could in that game and I think if you're in a mini league and you've got Salo and half the mini league have J you would be watching J and thinking oh God he looks incredibly dangerous and I'm I'm worried that he's going to hit a big hole I mean obviously the J would be worried about that with Salah but then there's five million difference and what can do with that in your score because I don't think if they both start and they both play 90 I don't think there's that much in it between them I don't think they play 90 I think I think we'll see that um I think J will go off after 70 yeah yeah but I I think josa can do damage in 70 minutes against it witch I mean I I'm I'm going into the season thinking it witch Leicester and sampton early on will concede a lot of goals I'm that's the premise I'm going with and I don't think that's an unreasonable thing to presume um and certainly against the stronger teams and we've already got scenarios where Newcastle plays Southampton we've got Man City playing its witch in gameweek two we've got Liverpool playing itwi in gameweek one we've got Spurs at Leicester in gameweek one we've got great really strong attacking teams playing teams that we expect to concede a lot of goals or could expect to we'd be silly to not jump on them even if they are short-term options in my opinion yeah and by booking in the Wild Card don't let yourself turn your back on those short-term options because you're scared that you'll be needing to use transfers because you you're assessing about saving transfers playing the wild card and coming out with free transfers I just think it that that rule change where we can roll transfers could make us much more cautious than we should be over what is a very turbulent normally a very turbulent period of the season the first three or four game weeks well the fact is as well is that Liverpool are one of the teams you mentioned is having that fous swing in GRE week 4 so if you can have two of those already in a jotter and a trend or a Salah and a Tren whatever thenly you don't need the world card to to Target them yeah no absolutely um right I want to look at our neighbors before we talk about you've got just before we do that we're getting quite a few questions about the yellow disc behind you so would you mind just clarifying what that is that's the that's the stere lab tray that I got um there is a story behind that well I won't bore everyone but um yeah um my my partner's half sister lives next to the man who does the stere lab merchandise I love stere lab and I got gifted that that that tray there they're a band they're very good band look them up very good if swats in the in the audience he would he will back that up as well enablers and disruptors now this is another thing that I posted about on X recently um that I think should influence our gameweek one lineups I think I've never seen a us go into game week one with so many options at lowlevel prices in Midfield so the players I'm listing here and they're in order of the ease of their fixture so in order of out their difficulty of fixture Smith out top Andreas Hudson Ado Bob kamada they've got the easier fixtures amongst this lot but if we go down to this Smith row at 55 Andreas at 55 husn Ador at 55 Oscar Bob at five million kamalo at Palace 5.5 ree Nelson I think will get a move so perhaps he's not an option now but could be later 5 million Rogers 5 million ion Bonet 5 million just gone to Leicester I believe G through yeah madidi at Leicester 5.5 on penalties we think SEO could be out front 5.5 for Bournemouth amedo man united five Millions played a lot of preseason minutes Barrett and Diaz who was decent last season 5.5 Min 5.5 who's been Stellar in preseason Gomez at wolves they got tough pictures but he looks outstanding in preseason and I haven't mentioned carvalo who's gone to brenford who I think he's 55 as well he may even be five million carali sure five another one then right so huge amount of options at 5 million 55 I remember Joe saying to me when I got um loft to Chic on my wild card you can't run away from Loft to Chic my argument here is if you go Oscar Bob for game week one and I think man of the match in the community Shield why wouldn't he start against Chelsea and why perhaps wouldn't he start against itswitch when fod and Etc coming back why do you not you can go Oscar Bob and you can keep 5 million in the bank and there is a whole cast of players you can move from when you think Bob is going to lose his place so why wouldn't you do that is is there an argument to say why you wouldn't do that because you're getting a man city asset and you're possibly then taking Bob and Harland into it itswitch game I think there's a very good chance he plays well at Chelsea and he doesn't get dropped against hits witch I think he's in that I completely agree I the argument is is that you're having a 55.5 million player in in your team um when if I mean if you're going harand Salah and Trent then this is essential that you get the right players and you have that flexibility and that balance but I guess for people who aren't picking Salah and Harland who are spreading that money around are you gonna be picking one of these players over the likes of En kunu e uh you know the six FS Gordon you know so so many Midfield spots that you could put in at the six5 and up bracket do you want to be going down to a 55 that's my point right if you're sitting there with a team and you've got a and Gordon and and and and a Bruno and you spread the money and you've got a really strong Midfield but the price points you've got are all above six5 six5 or above yeah and then what happens if Rogers and Bob have an amazing couple of first games they start going up in price what are you going to do you're gonna say because obviously you're going to look at it and go well yeah but look at my Midfield why would I sell Bruno to get Rogers why would I sell in kungu to get Rogers meanwhile Rogers is going up 51 52 53 and you're possibly losing the Palmer of this season you don't know I mean it's a big ass but that could happen so if you're sitting there with a really stocked Midfield but you haven't got a low price point player you're likely to find it very difficult to sell a 65 or seven million midfielder to move to a Rogers or a seeno or a Min because you're gonna think well why would I get rid of Bruno to get my why would I get rid of e to get mte but the trouble is you're fall into trap that I fell into of Aaron Ramsey back in the day where I didn't move off my good players to get Ramsey thinking that he would drop off and he didn't and he became the bargain of the season and the reason why I finished so poorly That season there's so many of these players any one of these or more than one could just blow up early on and then you'll have a dilemma going well do I sell Gibbs white to go and get Rogers do I sell and kungu to go and get Rogers and W meiz he's he's sore and in price that's the danger I think I've never seen anything like it I mean to me playing devil I I do agree with a lot of what you're saying and you know in most of the drafts I've had I've had one of um Smith row or M because I think they're both of this list I think they're the standouts yeah more so than Bob more so than Rogers who who I've had but yeah I think I think those those two are the best but a do I want to be building a team you know around a 5.55 million slot when I can have better players essentially and also you you say do you want to be selling them well if it's been two weeks and A's blanked against brenford and West Ham then yeah I would be happy to and you know if he hasn't blanked then I'm keeping him because you get e in for gameweek one he blanks twice and then you'd think he's a candidate to sell even though his pictures are really good would you on penalties and because like Rogers gets two and two against West Ham and Arsenal then you've gotta you got you gotta consider it haven't you yeah you like but it's much easier to go Bob to Rogers isn't it and and you know you haven't then got money in the bank you've then got to spend if you if you go a to Rogers you've got 1.8 1.7 in the bank as well unless you make another transfer so you're you're worse off than if you start the season with a five or a 55 you've at least got someone you can move off to the the next one that and I don't think these are long-term options at all but I think if you give yourself that price point in your team to start with you've got that easy platform to move to the next one whereas if you go in with midfielders R 65 and above you've got to draw down and have money in your bank when you drop down and make that move so that's a that's somewhat of a disadvantage and I think you'll be less inclined to do it I think you'd wait more game weeks and go no I'm Gonna Keep Faith with E and I'm Rogers is a flash in the pan and then there's a danger you miss it that's all I'm saying but is that is is that like the right way to think is that the right kind of behavior I agree that you probably will have that but it's at the end of the day it's the same my dad's gonna hate me for saying that he hates that that phrase but at the end day it's the same result is it selling selling a bob or an A for Rogers is you're still getting in Rogers doesn't matter if you've gone from Bob and I've gone from E the difference that you say is the money and then what you've done with that money elsewhere but it's never a bad thing to have the money in like if I've got two free trans upgrade the 4.5 to to someone else but it's just it's just in the argument about Oscar Bob there be people are saying well I'm not going to get a player who's not going to keep his place and he's going to lose his place in gameweek three fine in gameweek three I move to Rogers Rogers you know Rogers has got great fixtures from that point on or if I don't move to robers I move to cavalio if I don't move to cavalio I move to MTO you know there's so many options there that make it very viable to start with Oscar Bob and you could get Oscar Bob at home to it witch the flip side is though is that say a 65 asset emerges that you really want like say Brennan Johnson scores okay if he scores in the first two he's got a tough for f but you know say a six five option emerges and you've got that five and you need that point five because I've got Winks you know Winks is in there at the moment play but you know I'm saving the point five on on Rogers to use elsewhere and it could be because we know these price Rises are so volatile that 0 five is is key so by having a bob or a Rogers that could limit you from getting in a 657 asset who I'm not I'm not saying don't have a 65 I'm saying have that price point covered as well yeah I'm just saying if you have the lower price point covered because there's a cast of players that could just blow up I think it makes it easier to move and I think it's it's mainly about the discussion on Bob who was who I think will start the first two games and we just don't know how it's going to go if he's playing well Pep's going to keep him in the team they've sold Alvarez of course as well I I just think it's I think I've just not seen many teams of Bob in I'm quite shocked because I was like well if he plays well against in the community Shield then people are going to get him but I'm not seeing it I'm not seeing it yet and I just find it strange and I I I just think these will be disruptors these will be players who will disrupt our squads because one or two of them will will really kick off and then we'll want to move to them and I I completely agree with that and I think you know the danger of going for Smith Row for example in normal Seasons would be at 55 if he doesn't deliver or he gets injured oh crap I've got to you know ruin my team especially if he's a fourth midfielder for example I've got to ruin my team for him whereas we've come through preseason now and this list is important because exactly what you said at the start you can run away from them if there's an issue and in the past that has been at six million or 65 we've never had that a five five five um I mean last year there was Palmer at five and a dingra I went for a that's fine yeah you went for Palmer and obviously it was it was different but if both you know if if Palmer had flopped people would have gone to a dingra and he was like not that great an option let's to be honest and that would wouldn't have worked out but you look at this there's gonna be three or four I think from this list who who do well you can move to them with fixtures go Bob for the first two and then move into Rogers he's have you got Bob in your team by any chance Mark but I just think really that's ideal I just think if you save not five as well then you know you've got the ability to move off Bob to a 55 and there's plenty of them as well so I just think it's really viable tactic and going back to them as a neighbors you said earlier that salanki isach Watkins harand suddenly we've got maybe Tony suddenly we've got four or five really top tier Strikers that might mean we need to go three up front well the way to afford it is to have a couple of these and there's nothing wrong with that because for once we've got really good options I think and it makes harand sah and a cardia or a Trent viable I think because I think if you look at the the teams people were putting out a few weeks ago I don't think they were viable when Rogers was like the only five million and he was fourth midfielder for people who who have those teams I don't think that works whereas now I think you can build a decent team with Salah Trent and Harland and have like Smith R and M in a rotation with maybe J Pedro and you know sort of pick two of those and you still look pretty strong going forward so it's made having the really expensive premiums better as well um Daniel B says um Bob is a transfer out after game week two though using a man slot and you can't get away from him if he goes down I don't think he's gonna I don't think his ownership's going to go high enough where he'll go down so quickly for starters and we don't know that Bob is a transfer out after gameweek two he probably will be but I I don't think that's an issue and if you save n five you can get to Rogers anyway even if Rogers goes up and Bob goes down and going Bob to Rogers is an excellent move I think if Rogers keeps his place and if he doesn't you can go carvalo and the other thing is you got Winks in your team at 45 how is Winks a better option than taking a chance on Bob in case he blows up for an extra not five that's my question don't don't not win don't bring him into this five difference and you're you're going in with a player for four or five who's just going to sit there and come off the bench when you feel like it against a player for not five more who could be this season's Palmer I just don't I just yeah I do disagree with Daniel that I don't think Bob has any chance of of going down he's 2% owned and I think even if he if he starts in gameweek one even if he blanks his ownership is going to go up because people are going to see a five billion asset from City you know going up the only chance he has of going down in price is if his ownership increases about 5% then he doesn't start game week one he's definitely starting game week one yeah he like the best player in preseason so yeah yeah yeah absolutely 1600 16 th no 1692 sorry 16,000 nice I can only think

you're interested marvelous um yes so great to see so many join us on on the live stream yeah thank you everyone for joining really appreciate Sunday's The Way Forward right you're going to talk some Arsenal stuff now aren't you because you've had some help with this I'm sure you're going to give some credit to uh to those involved so over to you as on this one absolutely this is so we had this uh last season um from uh from Ashley uh surname Chapel Ashley Chapel who did some great analysis when Gabrielle lost his place and what that might mean for uh you know kind of the the defense and and different things he sent us another analysis obviously big Arsenal fan really gets these tactics absolutely amazing um and talked about the impact of um Calif fiori is that how you pronounce his name Cal fiori coming in at at left back yeah do that's fine and what that what that might mean and I mean this this might be kind of Fairly obvious for a lot of people but you know for bear with me I mean Arsenal really were really strong on their right hand side last season and you know that isn't that is an obvious thing to say you know Ben White odard and sacka that kind of Trinity around them won them so many games and if you just flick through these these screens quickly you can see the different rotations you know white can drop odard over to the left they can have sacka coming over to the right they can have Ben White going further the pitch and sacka drifting in narrow that combination was was so key to so many I haven't got the other screens up for you sorry basically just showed them in in different positions so it's fine yeah those three rotate in that Trio don't they were one going outside in the overlap one dropping in and one cutting inside basically and and and he did talk about the relationship between those players in relation to Ben White on that side yeah so that isn't going to change and Ben White is 0.5 million more than the others and I think that's a good price for him we weren't saying that last year when he was a bit more expensive but you pay a bit more you get a bit more attacking and you get someone who's such a key part um of of kind of what what arsenal were building um the issue with Arsenal last year was the left- hand side was nowhere near as potent and you know marel he started the season he come off the back of really good good year he really struggled early on trar came in and did a lot better but trar was kind of moved around they couldn't really decide on left back either um you know zinchenko did what didn't start the season did he but then came in and kiwi all started and Tommy Yu played there for a bit but then got injured um so the question is they needed to strengthen in that area and they have got Timber back he was a big loss to them last year when he when he missed out but now they've signed this uh this Cal fiori and if you just bring up his his heat m f isn't aware cury played um last season mostly as a as a center back so you can see that from the first heat map on the top left it's almost in the kind of Gabrielle mold drifts over to the to the left covers around that kind of position but still getting forward even from you know that that kind of Center back position the year before that I believe he was in the Swiss league and he played predominantly as a left back in that league and you can see his heat map on on the right and if you compare that to Ben White's on the other side very very similar in terms of those positions that he's taking out Ben maybe more more kind of in in those attacking areas so what does that mean for for Arsenal well firstly I think it's a brilliant signing for them in the sense and this is what Ashley agrees with in the sense that they they're just going to be as good defensively as they were last year even or potentially even stronger they've got key that was interesting reading what Ashley said with the big question can they repeat last year's you know robustness in defense and really be that top team and he really feels they can be and cury is something that's going to add to that absolutely and he he's a he's a top top class player um who can who can play in kind of both his Visions he's going to put pressure on Gabrielle I think Gabrielle is a complete noo for me in in FPL because I think Timber is going to play some games at left back and that could mean cury playing at Center back it could mean Gabrielle I think Gabrielle probably still starts the majority of games but there's definitely some risk with it there's no risk on the right hand side with cber and and white you don't think White's under threat at all Timber could play but yeah I I think the relationship he has with odard sacka which you saw on the previous screen is key to him it's a big risk to take out one of the key players from that Trinity whereas on the left they're still building to see what that is going to look like going forward like we don't know if it's GNA be martinell or trar that start the season it's probably going to be Martinelli um but but yeah I mean I like I said I think Gabrielle is still going to start and I think cury is going to be the one that nails down that left back um spot um he is he's a this is kind of some of the stuff that Ashley said from from his analysis um the fact he's so versatile the fact he's got great combination play and has done that from left back um in in the past he's a great defender generally and also he's really tall and will add some real setpiece um threat you know to to their game so he's expecting calori to be possibly even the go-to Arsenal player once he's established in the side there is going to be that bit of a risk that he might miss a game with zinenko whoever but he is definitely definitely one to watch but all of this just made me think if you're going for an Arsenal Defender it's CBA six million safe in the team he scored I believe in the preseason game as well he's the one to get I think Ry is the one to get I think you go five five yeah I I think what what I read from Ashley's report was that if the arsal defense is expected to perform as it did last season and there's doubt about Gabrielle yeah I like Cela but I just don't see why you wouldn't go to reyya and then Overlook the rest I mean I'd love to get to Ben White at 65 I'd love to have that fund but if I if I'm going to go Trent then I think Ray is the way to go in order to enable Trent that's my view but if you if you're not going Trent then CBE yes I agree I'd even try and stretch to White if you're not going TR yeah I just think I mean the four five goalkeepers aren't aren't that inspiring let's let's be honest about that but I think there's enough of five million to to get you by with yeah I agree yeah with that and I don't really want to be going up to a to a five five um and also I think if cury can establish himself in the team um then that might be an Arsenal spot that we that we want to keep reserved for for him going forward but again we can wild card on that a bit later but yeah I won't I won't be starting with with an Aral Defender I don't think but you're not I think so uh let's talk Brighton now another one of your favorite subjects and this is um this is a gift that you got off Reddit from never mind 721 to talk about um Hazel's um tactics so do you want to go through that I love how you rush through love how you rush through that that pronunciation HZ I believe yeah it's really I've been watching a lot of a lot of videos about about Brighton and tactics you know before we we went into preseason um James Ott has done a brilliant video on on um on Brighton so I strongly recommend anyone who's interested to watch that he talks about the tactics and and things but the the kind of GFS on the on the screen is is really interesting because it shows um how we play with three three center backs and and the two fullbacks but the the the center back pushes into Midfield and the two defens midfielders push up as well kind of really high um and the Wingers kind of come in inside to receive the ball and what I've been watching I think the Villa Royale game was almost a full strength team for us um in you know in in the sense that we had most of our our players out there there's the lineup perfect yes thanks I you that that's great yeah and it was it was re it was one of the best performances I've ever seen from from Brian and you know it's a preseason game Vel like an eighth or Ninth Place team they're no they're no pushovers but well Forest I watched them at Forest we drew nil nil and they they were a decent side you then you just pushed them aside four-nil so wor in terms of Forest for sure well they could have scored in the first like 30 seconds because they they broke through on goal and and I think hit the post um but the game as the game went on you just saw the control that that Brighton had in the game you saw players that were completely bought in to this system and that was the worry with derer leaving and with a new Young manager coming in he's he plays a different style but it's it's a similar you know dominating possession um Triangles around the defense he likes to go direct as well but the key thing that we that I think is important and just just to mention is that the the pressing that Brighton do is very different so what Brighton do is when they lose the ball they go gung-ho to win the ball back and as soon as they win the ball back they then push everyone for forward to try and overload and and score the amount of goals we've scored this preseason from that tactic where we've lost the ball everyone's jumped on it grabbed the ball back and we pushed and and and hit them and the best player who's who all preseason who's done that time and time again is min his awareness and reading and work rate and pressing is honestly it is absolutely absolutely Elite so if anyone's sat and watching this and thinking oh I'm bit worried about about M's minutes there's lots of options at Brighton do not be worried about his minutes he is key to everything Herz is going to do the other key players to the system are J Pedro because he was praised for his work great and his linkup play was absolutely exceptional in that game and the other one is Barco do not think barco is a four million Defender because he isn't he's on set pieces he's on Corners he uh he's very attacking he's he plays direct he'll get the ball and he'll just ping it over the top for someone to run on to he's going to get assists from that as well we look better defensively because we drop if we don't win the ball back on that High Press we drop and sit deep and make it hard for teams to um to play against us and I don't even think the Super's gonna get his place back in the team because I think bar they're looking to strengthen in that role though aren't they they're looking they're looking to bring players in so that's the danger that long term baros could be could be at risk but I agree I think that what I saw of Brighton in this fixture and the fact they they just dismissed Villa Royale 4-0 a team that I'd seen a week earlier who fairly decent made me think well Pedro is a lock because he's he looks fit enough and will start and he's on pens I've got to start taking Min seriously it really depends on his end product but he's gonna start and he's not the enablers he's got it he's got to be someone I consider when the fixtures improve and Barco I think has to be the formul in Defender I start with because there are other other options long-term options Howard Bellis Etc Johnson maybe but why not go Barco it's the same argument about about the uh the Bob thing it's like Barco could really kick off if you don't go him and he gets an assist and Brighton get a clean sheet early on he's going to shoot up in value and then you're gonna have a dilema particularly if you're trying to save transfers so going Barco for million I don't think it's a big risk um because I think that we're going to Wild Card at some point either in four or in eight and we can get rid at that point and he might go down to 39 but I think it's worth the risk I really do yeah I don't think I think it's it's more likely that he comes away from that game with something against Everton an assist from a a corner or even a clean sheet or or something and he ends up 4.2 4.3 I just think he's he even if we signed another player who could play I mean right back is the problem belman was targeted over and over again in that game um that's the bigger issue um imagine maybe we bring in a player who can play right or left but that's got to be the priority in fixing the the side on on the right um even if comes back Barco could shift into Midfield he could int could play a trend these balls he pings over the top his awareness and reading of the game is is unbelievable he is honestly he's a top top talent so if you look at the pictures here gameweek four and five it switch from forest at home that's where You' got to look at bright you that's where you've got to try and get on and if you look at um going back to Lego man's brilliant graph here look at the swing as well in in gameweek 12 onwards look at that run there game week 12 Bournemouth then it's Sav Anon at home fham away Leicester away Palace at home West Ham away brenford at home we've got to have Brighton players for that spell I would have said I mean obviously we get a bit more data so we know about M we know about Barco but take Barco into game week one and hold him and then definitely look at M if you haven't got J Pedro but I I think there's no reason with they start strongly you won't have three Brighton players at some point and that could be the the window to do it right absolutely yeah and I think J Pedro has obviously been underpriced he should be 65 I strongly believe that I think barco's been underpriced he should be 45 um but he could easily become a 5 million is asset Min is obviously a bit of an unknown and there is rotation there and 55 probably is about right for him um but all three of them will be factors for this season got no doubt I will stop talking now I've got a lot excellent stuff no it's a good I mean it's it's it's great I think it's great to have Brighton back as an option because last season they they were just out of it because of the rotation and because of erratic form and no clear options um going back to that uh graph with graphic with with the center back pushing forward I guess that would be dun will bit in the central position pushing into Midfield is that how you see it well it it probably it should be I think because he is a very good pass of the ball and you wouldn't want him as one of the wide center backs because he's got no Pace to to kind of come in I think it's a bit of a problem area though because I still don't really want him doing that so much he should you still expect him to be kind of marshalling defense and back um again I mean James mentioned it on on planet FPL he he thinks that Dunc is potentially a bit of a problem in this system because if there is a quick count that needs doing or you know recovering is he the person to get back quick he's he's obviously getting on a bit now he's been a great servant for us um he's adapted to this new kind of passing range but he could be a potential um you know loser of of this system if they want to bring in someone a bit faster and you know to protect because counterattacks are going to be a big concern I think if we're if we lose the ball and we press everyone forward and then they ping a ball over over the top I think we're gonna get so you will concede goals that's how you see it right you're not you're not you're not a banker for clean sheets but it's got It's scoring goals that you think it's yeah I I I think our defense will improve I think we would be we'll be a better defensive unit than we were under derer because deserie didn't seem to have a plan B when when it came to he would just play the same way whereas herzler I think is more astute and the and from what I saw the shape we get into when the other team has the ball for a bit and he kicking it back we suddenly drop all our players back and you've suddenly got J Pedro playing like behind the halfway line and and the and the Midfield stuck in it kind of stifles it but that like 20 30 seconds when we try and win the ball back that's going to be the the danger the danger zone yeah no I get it there good points that's nice to hear that you're positive about you know theer's departure and the new and the new regime um shall we from from M Bugsby I don't think there's any wrong with that what's Gordon home to sampton Bob Gordon I don't there's any wrong with Bob gon and Barco Diaz maybe but yeah I I intend to have those three I think when we look at our teams do you want to look at preseason Lessons Learned or do you want to look at our teams and then look at the lessons learned and see what we're going against let's do that instead shall we let's bring up your team first uh I need to resize that because you Dro that in yeah sorry drop that last don't know why it's so big that's all right I'll do it quickly on there there we go that's there's a few people saying that I'm overhyping Brighton and of course I'm guilty of that we're all doing that on our own team but do you remember when deserie signed and I said he was going to be an evolution from Potter and it turned out he was I mean it went sour in the end but for a bit he uh he was great I genuinely think herzler is the next Evolution from derer I think it's an outstanding appointment really excited to see what happen this this year so baros there do you want to read the team out for the podcast yeah so this has changed quite a bit um it's Henderson in goal which I don't feel completely comfortable with because I I like Johnston but I think Henderson will will start it's Trent porro Barco Saka jot eay enu Harland isach and sanki and then a bench of Bentley uh Robinson winks and vestard so there isn't a lot on the bench the idea would be to bring in Robinson forco and then I think that 11 is very strong um essentially but it doesn't leave me with much of a bench um but they're all starters vard winks and bar will all play and if a player doesn't start or is injured then I would look to to take them out the biggest thing was earlier today I had Salah in the team and I think it was Salah and Smith row it was Salah Smith row and vardal I think that was the main difference and now it's Trent jotter and enu and I think Trent jotter enku is a better a better three enu is interesting because I mean I'm starting now to look at my team more about I want to pick a really strong team for game week one and have a bench that can come in for game week two and you've got players like Robinson there with that in mind I mean wins and vestard I don't think vestard will start for Leicester I think AI the new signing will probably come in yeah so I think I think you'll probably change that but there are options there face or another for yeah face will probably start I think that's the that's the thinking I've gone off on kungu because it's just like I'm taking a player in and probably having in the start player against Man City gameweek one and in kungu I don't think we'll get 90 minutes because I think that there'll be options on the bench that will mean that he'll probably he'll start I think he'll start we don't know where he'll start um but you know it's never great to have a player at home to City because we don't know how many goals can be scored in that game you know Chelsea might surprise doesn't get two or three goals but I don't don't think it so it's put me off I mean I know they go to wolves and then the fixtures really swing so I'm all foring kungu game week three onwards but this is what I was talking about earlier about are you going in kungu because you're deliberately trying to save transfers and you want him for gameweek three onwards so therefore you've got him gameweek one because you want to get him now because you don't want to make transfers because what would be wrong with going Gibbs white at home to Bournemouth and then transferring Gibbs white to Inu for Wolves Away why wouldn't you do that is it purely because you don't want to use a transfer well don't get me wrong I mean I that spot I think is is one which is is changing all the time and like I said when I when I think about my top three I think it's enu I think it's between enu B and maybe even sosai if I wanted to Triple upo really maybe he he's the left field one I think en kunu is obviously very highly owned I'm a bit he he's a I don't often do this but he is a bit of a kind of a coverage player because I do think he he's got high ownership he could line up up front against Man City he has had a very good preseason and they have got good fixures after game one I don't really want to be scrambling around for him you know if he does score against City looks good and then he on the The Run he has I don't really want to be scrambling around for him so he's sort of in mind for that but I do like Bailey I like gacho as well I think gacho at 65 is a is a good pick HUD um Huds Gibs white is a good pick as well he's he's definitely consideration it could it could be any of them like I just think inu's a popular pick and I absolutely get it but I don't necessarily get it for gameweek one when they're playing City and I'm all for try I'm going to try and pick the best side I can for game one rather than get a player in you w okay one of the reasons why I actually bought him in was because and one of the reasons why I've taken I think they score yeah I looked at city and thought they've got a lot of players missing um berardo Silva spoken and said Pep's given them an extended break because a lot of them were tied that's absolutely great but it's not great when you haven't got rodri back for example and you're getting fact sure back in late and okay they've sorted everything out of Edison now and that's good but you know they were playing kids in the community shield and harl wasn't getting the service there was a bit of kind of we've seen it before we saw it two years ago in Harland struggled in his first game and then scored a brace against against West Ham he's he's obviously still in my team but I think Chelsea will be confident they can get at city in that game and it could be enu up front right because it could be Netto on the left and you know they could build the team around en yeah it could be and and Caleb don't get me wrong I absolutely rate kka as a six5 option for the season it's just are we forgetting that we can transfer him in right I I don't think he's going to go up to 66 ahead of gameweek two I I don't necessar think he's going to get returns in gameweek one that's going to mean he's going to get a price rise so I think you could go with a stronger option for gameweek one and move to Inu for game week two if you really wanted him at wolves but it's game week three that I won him for because of the run so I absolutely want to have him but do I want him for game week one do I not want to just optimize for the first couple of game weeks and then move to Inu and the reason why I'm not worried about doing that is because I'm not obsessing about saving transfers and I think some people are is is what I'm saying yeah no I completely get that I I think one of the other reasons though is is I have there is risks in this team like there is jotter um there is the fact that I've got sort of Barco and and Robinson there is I mean even Trent for example with with Bradley even Henderson like could be could be at risk so there's I kind of I kind of I think I'll be all right don't get me wrong but I kind of want Inu in because I know I'll probably want him from gameweek three and at least he's there and then if I do have another fire to put out which I probably will because it's my gameweek one team then at least i' you know I know that enu is probably going to C good in in game week three unless he doesn't start the first two games and then it's you know I do look at this and think it does look like a team you're GNA wild card in game three or between gameweek three and four L because Winks Andes wink winks and a four million Defender are you are you thinking that's a long-term thing that you're going to have two promoted team players in on your bench I mean Robinson's good because he's got a good run so I get it but I don't think it matters because I'm not looking at Barco as a four million Defender I'm looking at him as someone who's definitely going to play right up until October maybe longer do you you think he's gonna even if they buy you think he's gonna hold a spot do you yeah I think streng I think who will buy will come in at right back I don't think he's going to come in I don't think barco's got any any danger he's had such a good preseason and he's there's no reason to to bring in a like a pure left back to to put in place when we've got a stupland coming back and Bar I mean you we've got Milner who can come in if if we need to play him at left back um we've got we've got a couple of options there it's definitely the right side where we're where we're weaker um so I mean wins and vestig guard are just you know then the idea is I never play them that's why they're there're at 4.5 and and four um and the transfers can be used elsewhere I do appreciate there's there's less flexibility there's less flexibility with this team than there was when I had Salah because I had and Min and all that but I really like I really like the 11 yeah I mean yeah I don't and I mean getting on salanki with the Spurs move is great not knocking any of the Midfield picks there's no weakness there other than perhaps if Barco loses his space all you've got is Robinson to bring in really so it's just the strength in depth that I worry about but if you're convinced Barco plays week in week out even after the window then there's no there's no danger is there so yeah and I think it's the fact that Robinson's got games right up until game week seven you know it's it's Leicester I switch West Ham Newcastle at home still a home game Forest you know that's five games where I'm more than happy to play him in in those so yeah if if bco does lose his place and I'm stuck with Trent porro and Robinson then that's that's fine yeah all very good okay let's look at my latest I mean this changed today as well no one's slating it which is which is UN you know unheard of when we show I'm sure I'm sure I'll get more criticism because I've got I've got some risks in here although I think I've got stronger what are the odds of that you've got exactly the same well you took cah out and you've gone for J and sacka yeah because I think that losing Salah getting J in means I can go Trent um so the team for the podcast Ry in goal porro coner Trent Barco and Robinson are my Defenders and in Midfield it's jotter Bob Gordon sacka and Smith row Isaak harand and jel Pedro I don't know if this is what I'll go with it's changing every day every hour but what we have got now is the preseason friendly stuff in the next show we do on Thursday will be an analysis of the preseason and that might influence what I end up with and what I put in at Fest um Thursday show by the way will probably be a bumper one because we're probably going to do a QA after as well so that could be three or four hours the way we're so be tuned for that um I'm taking this here with quer I'm taking this here with Bob and I'm taking this here with Barco but what the caveat here is I'm not saving transfers I'm I'm and I've got not five in the bank so if I have to move off Bob in game week three or even game week two I can move to a 55 and I as I've said earlier I think there's some good five fivs the dream scenario is I don't need to move off Bob and I can bench him and he gets some minutes off the off the bench on regular occasions because pep likes him and don't forget I've got Smith row to come in here so I don't need to play Bob week in week out because otherwise I I ever playing otherwise I'm benching jbro week in week out who's a penalty taker playing for Brighton so Bob's not in my starting 11 every week even if I keep him because Fulham have a great run and I want to play jaia Pedro probably right I've got KN five the dream T know is I I save that KN five I keep Bob and I go isaach to Watkins for gameweek three that would be ideal I don't think I'm going to need to move quono out because I've got Robinson there and I've got Barco and either of those two can come in if Quan does lose his spot I think Quant is gonna start so do I and I think he starts the season and he's going to be slots choice because he's better on the ball he's got better distribution he's not a good a Defender as Kari but he's getting there and I think he's long-term partner for van djk so I'm happy with quona I'm happy with the Bob RIS because it's short-term and Barco you've just made me feel a lot happy about Barco I think having Smith R and Robinson is great because I love fulham's run and I think they will score goals and I can't get to munz yet although another scenario for that KN five might be Xiao Pedro to munes if I don't need to change Bob so I like having KN five in the bench and in the bank and I think there are places to run from Bob that means I can have him for the first two and he if he starts against itswitch having bobber molland against hwit could be a really handy differential to have because I don't think many teams will have two City attackers I don't think many are gonna take a risk on foden for game week two no so I I like this at the moment with the N five in the bank what do you reckon it's great in lip Swit score yeah they could uh no I like it yeah it's um it's funny isn't it you take Salah out though and and I obviously sacka is there but because he's been an 8 million asset for so long it just looks a bit light doesn't it in Midfield because that's how I feel when I look at my Jos has got to carry that hasn't he yeah yeah it's I'm looking at and thinking oh these are like seven eight million assets and obviously they're not I but it might even be the same when you had foden and palmering because obviously they haven't been big asses as well so Saka has to now Step Up doesn't he and become you know take another level up to to become that asset that lets us think okay are we going to Captain him over Holland um this week I mean he is a captaincy option for this week against wolves having lost Netto um as well so yeah he he he obviously needs to deliver but I mean he's more than K doing that because he's a he's an amazing player um you definitely got more Flex flexibility than than my team um but it's also quite similar to my team so I'm I'm just amazed that this is the third one we've done and each time we went we were completely different on the first one and then we both I think for Salah was it on the second one and then we' both gone for J and Trent on the first one and we haven't seen each other since or even really SP yeah and it's it's not output it's not the goals and assists today it's the xmin XMS they both going to start at if switch so and and Trent's playing right back now now that seems certain so now we know that I think it's it's Folly not to let that influence our decisions and jotto I can move away he's 75 so you can move down to e game week three if I don't if I don't make a transfer going into gameweek two I've got two transfers going into gameweek three and those two transfers could be Bob to a 55 and J down to e which still gives me not five in the bank so I could even go Bob up to a six if I go J down to e and I think jotto over the first two is stronger than having E I mean panis could win a penalty at brenford and panis have got West Ham game week two it's an okay fixture but Liverpool have got you know it switch it switch away and what's the second game it's it's strong as well it's a strong home game brenford is it brenford at home yeah brenford at home I I think jot is stronger than e and then I can move off jot if he's if I feel he's not going to keep the starts which he probably won't I'm not saying that these are long-term picks what I am saying though is I'm optimizing for the short term and I'm going to spend transfers to move away from the players and I've got a good bench to allow me a bit more time to do that so I I like it but I don't know how much this will change now two two things one is for both of us what happens if Salah scores a brace game we won we're finished I mean Salah scores a brace and and Trent and jota get nothing is that what we're saying yeah could happen but it's unlucky I I think if there wasn't isach there with that home game against Southampton I I would be much more tempted to go with sah but ISAC is such a good captaincy pick for game at one and the second one is a comment from the chat saying uh where's all your Forest players yeah so so I had Gibbs white in here until this morning but I've put golden back in Golden's the one who's probably hanging by Fred I might go golden down to a six five yet if I think there's any risk that he doesn't start I think he will start I think he may only get 65 70 minutes because obviously Murphy's done well preseason and Barnes could start on the left if I think Gold's not going to start I probably will more gold now either to e or to a Gibbs white or to a Brennan I won't go in kungu because I'll probably look to get in kungu later it could be J down to in kungu couldn't it like game three for example um yeah I I just think we've got there's so much fluidity available to us at many price points and I'll say it for about the fifth time I think hampering Yourself by saying no I want to bank transfers I want to roll transfers could be could be hurtful because I think the more agile we are in moving players around in and out of our teams the more chance we have of perhaps hitting hitting good fixtures with those Midfield players and I think that's going to be a trick this season I think moving our Midfield quickly two fixtures is going to be something until x-min is going to be something that we'll need to do I think the front line is going to be pretty settled I think there's four or five Strikers that we're going to rotate maybe but the rotation in Midfield is going to be a I think there's going to be a lot of that particularly if we keep porro and Trent and an Aral Defender we're not going to move those out a lot we're going to keep the main stays in defense Main Stays in the up front and it's going to be the Midfield that you're going to be fluid with so if you're going in with a Midfield which is set and forget until game week four I just I think think you might lose out a bit that's what I'm saying I think I think that might be a thing yeah yeah no I agree um I guess the the the decision I was I was thinking about with this was Pedro versus sanki um yeah I could end up with with Pedro but I just think you know I know we're not trying to not just saying about not thinking too short minded but those first two for Spurs ler ever you're surely going to be a bit concerned about sank and that I am and that's why I might go to Brennan from Gordon um and I might look at sank and see what I can do there if I go golden but I I don't want to go Bob Smith row and another 55 I don't want three I don't think I want three at that price point two is pushing it um so and Gordon at home the Southampton could really fly I mean it's it's a very he'll start how bench Gordon he loves him yeah and what 22 returns in home games I think you've got to think you got to be confident of something from that game haven't you so should we look at our lessons learned this is what we put together from previous seasons and it's interesting to read this in the context of what we've just seen because we've probably broken some of these oh God yeah so do you want to read through these for the podcast yeah so first one consider for game one on knowledge in in is it its weakest so prioritize proven picks and teams that could offer a degree of reliability so not Inu he's the first one that that comes to mind um I'd say we've got both we've both got some proven I mean Oscar Bob maybe isn't a proven pick you've gone about in more podcast but I reckon our teams are pretty much built from proven picks we got our sackers in there and obviously Harland and esack and you've got Gordon who did so well last season yeah and J's a proven pick I think e these are all these I think we've I think we've I think we're all right on on that one um beware of teams in transition who have made wholesale changes to key positions or the spine of the team who would fit into that I mean Bournemouth obviously losing sanky is is a big one yeah I don't think we've got that many teams who have done that really I I guess teams in transition those under new managers as well but well Chelsea as well Losing gallager You could argue and all the influx of players they've had yeah they're probably the nearest to this aren't they I think I am cautious about Chelsea I don't I really of the teams that have got new managers you spoke very well about Brighton today and you're confident I'm confident that slot with the fixtures they've got Liverpool aren't concerned Chelsea though I don't know now if they can exploit that kind fix to run yet we need to see them and we need more data you'd think they're going to do well over these fixtures but Mesa and what he's doing there he is making massive changes and I do worry that we won't they won't be able to fully exploit that run so I do think that's something I want to beware we I think the difference from what I've seen from Chelsea and from Brighton and yes I'm biased and yes I have a thing about Chelsea but I don't know if the Chelsea players have fully bought into mesa's philosophy yet and I think they they must be thinking there's so much uncertainty am I going to start the squad's about 50 players big you know they're going have to make like some sales I don't know if they're going to bring another player in their position they're trying to play a completely new system like at least with Bryon it was kind of another kind of a change in Direction in a in a way but minor whereas Chelsea's under poch to moresca is is obviously remarkably different and yeah I don't know I'm seeing like individual mistakes and I'm seeing maybe a lack of buying into to that philosophy so they are they will take time definitely and they haven't got the likes of Palmer back yet and obviously he's such a crucial component there's a question about do we think Palmer's output will be reduced I think there's a good chance I think there's a very good chance I mean the penalties will regress surely so he is gonna he is gonna dip I think but he's still an outstanding fancy asset but I'd rather be sure and go with someone like saaka or Salah rather than go Palmer early on I I need to see Chelsea first and you're not going to pick him game at one because he's had no no preseason no course he's not a f not F all yeah uh third one uh try to limit risks with your initial lineup and if you must take risk avoid doing so with heavy hitter options I think we've both done that Harland and sacka are in proven assets we haven't gone for I mean to be fair there aren't really any like no any um big new premiums are they're all they're all consistent they've all been priced accordingly so yeah I mean we have Tak I've taken a couple of risks with Quanto I think and maybe Bob but I think there's I've mitigated both of those with a good bench so I'm okay with that uh don't be sway by high ownership When selecting your initial Squad I've definitely done that with enu but I think that's about it on my side probably yours as well I haven't even looked at ownership yet i' stay Stayed well away from it I couldn't actually tell you what inu's ownership is I just know that he's very popular and he's going to be very popular um let's have a look 20 oh okay 17% it's actually lower than I thought yeah yeah um set your initial Squad so that you have the opportunity to react to bandwagons at a variety of price points you might have mention a lot yeah I think it's important and and and I think added to that this year and Future don't let an early Wild Card put you off making transfers and Jumping On bandwagons You' missed one there was let your plan and flexibility from going with nor to be your differential so what what we're saying there is don't worry about effective ownership if you've got a team that's template your differential will be what you do from that point on and so your plan that you have from gameweek one onwards let that be the thing that differentiates you from the template so if you want to pick the players that just happen to be in the template but you're convinced they're the best players to have don't worry about that because can differentiate from that point I think all of all the seasons we've had recently this season that's more likely to happen this season because of the variety in the pricing that we've got so do you know what I missed that one I think that's actually probably the best one on this list is and it's something that I'm guilty of every every year that I'll have a player in who uh you know I think maybe he's a bit of a differential then I see other people buying him and suddenly I'm put off him or I go for a player who's a temp I go off a player who's a template pick and yeah you're right it does doesn't matter just don't worry about whatever people are doing let decision later down the line Define the moves and and the FPL manager you want to be how about that about two beers uh where we up to now be mindful the high scoring yeah that's it yeah be mindful high scoring and cheap attacking players will perceive to offer the most value in ear game weeks so rise in price fastest yeah so that's Rose Ines your five and five Rogers if he scores in game week one um they could easily be five you know V be 52 53 could got point three so 10 others it won't be Barco and Quant that go up quickly they might go up in gameweek three or four but it will be the Rogers it'll be the Smith row if you're not on them and they score early on they're going up in price because they're attacking players high value they're always the ones that go up first because people change their attacking players more than their defensive players so be wary of that set yourself up so you can react to that if you're not going with them give yourself flexibility to move to them quickly um next one on the flip side on the flip side you have longer to defensive ban Vol defensive mes early I mean unless we get like a lrom or million Defender who could be that exactly just start with Barco if you take any the 1800 people watching please for me just start with Barco he might be rubbish but he could get an assist game with one and then you're floundering around for four million Defender just just start with Barco there's no reason not to um this is one for you with with Gordon potentially avoid any player who is not certain to start even if manager pre-season comments appear to increase confidence that that is gon isn't it g isn't it and salanki I guess as well because everything we've heard from an suggest salanki starts everything that Eddie how said about Gordon yes they suggest he would start but we've seen this particularly with Chelsea that you know managers are going to be positive about all their players for gameweek one they're not going to give too much away yeah so yeah that does make me think about Gordon I think he's the one that I'm taking most risks with I don't think there's others there I think Quanto and Bob will start but golden is the one that yeah well if if anything Pep's comments were playing down Bob weren't they because he was kind of saying he's good but he can improve and and and all this whereas Gordon and sanki are different and you've got Gordon and I've got sank um and finally try to avoid making multiple changes to your initial lineup at the last minute to include one player Mark we're at Fest on Friday I would urge anyone who hasn't got a ticket are the tickets still available there are tickets still available there it is Fest on Friday oh that's going to be amazing occasion but yeah can you please not let me make stupid last minute changes to my team can you just take my phone off me there's Wi-Fi this time so ifat we're treated to the internet this time amazing and live football just like remember my transfer last was it last year or the or the year before when I did what did you I did I think it was kesi to mount last minute right I it can't have been last year because I didn't have him when he was at United it was when he was at Chelsea and keski went on and got like two or three goals um and and mount didn't and on the last it was richison last for richison in I think I think what this is getting out in particular as well what you don't want to do is turn up on Friday at Fest without Salah and then put Salah in last minute and have to change three or four players around that as well because that's know you should know by Friday whether you who your premiums are at the very least that's the key don't to Friday and then change your premiums on Friday obviously that's going to mean a lot of changes so settle on that by Friday I think is important and obviously we've got a show on Thursday we'll we'll help you with that as much as we can and we're gonna do really good one that's gonna be really good yeah we're gonna do a Q&A we may even get guests on the show we may even have some guests we'll share the link with members or even maybe wider than that and we'll have some guests like a phone in option on Thursday show so we'll see so so that that

how are we today I I was ready to go a little bit earlier today so I thought why not I was just sitting here with my cup of tea and I thought let's just get stuck in shall we so uh thanks everyone that's joined a little bit early today we're live like 10 minutes or so early Yash says I'm seated I hope you all found your seats obviously starting a bit early so sorry if anyone was scrambling to find a seat there at the back but but welcome to the stream how are we all doing today uh welcome Mel diast Matt giten got lamb in your M on the chat Ridge smog farrish red onean Gavin edar KN tambuli good to see lots of members fandy how we doing 2K from 200k are we are we really when I woke up we were at 197,000 so we've just gone over 198,000 I don't know if we're going to hit it oh hang on that's not my team what have I done here good start hang on let me switch it over uh uh is it that one there we go sorry uh right lost my track yeah welcome all so yeah we must have hit that this morning then like in the last 20 minutes or so cuz I woke up and it wasn't on 198k yeah as I saying I don't think we'll hit it during the deadline stream but yeah we're closing in on the big 200k uh and obviously I've agreed to get the focal logo tattooed when we hit 200,000 so hit subscribe if you want to be a part of that piece be part of a piece of that history the focal tattoo where should I get it tattooed should I put a poll up um so where should we go forearm any suggestions foot for forehead forehead forearm maybe I'll put forehead uh where else somewhere else pal eyeball I don't think I should put forehead on the pole because then it's just going to ruin the pole because you're all going to put that cheek neck I don't know if I'll get it on my neck nipple tattoo that sounds so painful fingers forarm okay well those are the options biceps yeah maybe biceps that's not a bad shot either the inside of your bottom lip I think it's got to be somewhere that's kind of visible like no one's going to see it on the inside of my lip are they like a tra stamp back of the shoulder yeah I mean I want it somewhere Vis visible we're not too visible like and I also have to provide proof that actually get the tattoo I don't I don't have any tattoos by the way like oh FP CH in the chat I was talking to him about this when he was over for gami one and I think Dylan said he doesn't have any tattoos either but like he'd love to get one and he likes tattoos behind the a back of the a lot of people saying back of the year what like Edison's like Edison's with a smiley I don't know it feels a bit too visible eyelid that sounds so some of these suggestions on the shaft what the hell it's 10: to 9: in the morning chat's lost it already yeah so some price changes last night um who went up if anyone doesn't know on FPL page there's a little widget where you can actually track all the price changes let's see who went up loads of price changes last night so munes went up VY went up Bernardo xery and wood went up loads of price fallers don't if there's any notable ones there trippier went down califur went down that's good like if he breaks that breaks into the team which he will at some point when he cements himself he's going to be a steel for 5.9 maybe 5.8 maybe people will keep selling him we'll see and obviously the other news is uh who's got Barco hands up in the chat who's got Barco so he's gone to severe now on a season long loan uh he's red flagged in FPL though so that's good news his price is locked so he won't go down in price at least so Silver Linings but yeah bco is price lock so you're okay there if you've got him I think there's quite a lot out there I'm pretty sure he was like the fifth most owned Defender at at the time of game won I don't know if he is now or if his owners ship's gone down but um I think I saw a membership it was it it was virtual thanks for the seven months he says advice for a cursed K Quan baru and salanki owner well I would I would address salanki first prioritize that and I'm assuming your other three Defenders will play in which case I wouldn't take a hit so I would just get rid of salanki and I would say the best three Replacements are moones Mata and Armstrong I think they're all good maybe munz makes the most sense cuz he's home to Leicester you're buying the player with the best fixture there and then they've got IP switch away and then West Ham home so I'd probably go mooners if I had salanki now if you literally don't have a defense that plays then I think it's viable to take a minus four and use that extra how much is it one .5 to go you know quaner up to a 5 1 half mil Defender but yeah I wouldn't avoid hits at all cost if you can this week and just address salanki yeah I mean we did hands up who's got bco hands up who's got sanki I mean some people have got both like virtal which is so unlucky who's everyone replacing salanki with let us know in the chat I'll put a poll up in the SEC so 48% say forearm tattoo 25% somewhere else that's quite suspicious and then foot and finger all right let's do a poll for sanki yeah very unlucky that for sanky owners I mean did he miss a game last season maybe like one uh what were the options we'll go mateta moon is Armstrong and other obviously some of you might not be replacing maybe some of you already like sold qu so you don't want to take a minus four Gavin says Anderson's my problem this week that reminds me on the left hand side you see you've got the experts captaincy I've also swapped added a uh team news widget so periodically that will like swap in and then you'll just see all the headlines from the team news so I don't have to always run through all the team news like those are the headlines this week so like sank is out porro is fit qua picked off minor injury Tuesday trained on Friday Tony might not be in the squad again Anderson not in the palace Squad finalizing the move to fham uh and pep expects rodri to miss out again as well Ma has gone havitz yeah if you got the money havitz is the best pick I should have mentioned that earlier lot of people going Chris Wood Ryan's going chriswood so Ben Elliot's going wck so Aman Nathan's going xery very nice Devon thanks for becoming a member thanks very much for that Deon yeah if anyone wants to become a member join button below the stream supports the channel you get early access to videos there's a a member's channel on Discord you get a loyalty badge by your name so um yeah if you'd like to support me uh it's only like 1.99 Bertman says I have a sub and a point4 do I change Barco this week no not this week if you've got a sub and point four then uh just keep hold of him I know it's annoying but he's not an urgent transfer if you've got Defenders that play like I think a lot of bco owners are going to be keeping him for a few weeks now cuz there's other places where there's going to be more points to be gained than selling Barco for a foral Defender like I'm rolling this week and I can go foden and game three in two moves when they've got West Ham and brenford or if I can get to gamec four and I've got two transfers I could do sacka to Salah and something like isak toia Pedro or Bruno to a 5 1 half mil like Seena or Mente so yeah I wouldn't rush to sell Barco especially if you've got um Subs that can play ahead of him Joker says uh e j isak vardal best Captain Vice do you not have Salah hland Joker if you don't I'd go eak Captain jot Vice but Salah and Harland are the better captains harland's the best one this week um for me Ren says if you're a Salah owner and a salanki owner and you don't have any Man City players at all what team would you put together if you using a free hit a free hit oh I saw your um tweet Ren about free hit for me I wouldn't I wouldn't free hit this week cuz it's always more upside than a double in the blank really especially a double if you can free hit a full 11 of players at Double I think that's way more powerful than using it in the single but if I was using it now if I was using it now I think I'd have Harland and cah you may as well if you're on a free hit uh what would the team be I mean let's I guess we'll try and assemble a team so let's pull that up I'd keep Trent so I'd have Harland I'd leave isak if I can I don't know if I could afford that Moon is I take sacka out i' have Salah oh that could be a mistake Smith Ro probably leaving I take him out I'd leave e and I Think It's Tricky um I'd have vardal but I might be spending way too much now and I'd have porro so yeah that's not put 8 mil left so yeah I think I just go like super cheap here on the Defenders Howard Bellis coner down to just two four Ms something like this as the foundation and then those last two spots I'm not sure yet U but I think I'd go like that if I was on a free hit yeah definitely Trent vard or porro par is fit to play so love that one yeah I I think I'd Target that Leicester fixture with M and Smith ra you might as well go for it Salah Holland I'd have isaach I'd have uh I'd keep e home fixture yeah it's just those last two spots Bruno and in that' be the foundation of a free hit uh Devon thanks for the Super Chat as well no message on that one but thanks very much is sank going to drop to 7.4 mil uh let's have a look what's the price change is same he's minus 65% now so maybe not tonight but he will drop before game three yeah he will drop as annoying as it is sometimes the right players to just ride out the price drops we'll have to see if it was was the right play but I rode out the Quanza price for cuz I just think I'll have more exciting moves to make and in my case it's a bit different cuz I dunk who yeah it's not ideal but I can play him whereas if you've just got Barco for example as your back up then yeah you don't really have much choice at all people disrespect Chris Wood he's not a bad pick at all I just I mean isn't aneta joining forest and and then they've got a w as well to come off the bench where's Teddy he's around the families yeah theyve just picked him up they just got back from holiday yesterday so they've not seen him for like a week so uh their dog sitting Teddy today vardo or Robinson viio got be got be vardo I mean these are the clean sheet odds for game two City way out in front 57% uh then it's Liverpool 39 and a half uh Spurs Fulham another reason why Robinson's a solid transfer this week but obviously if you had Quanza and nothing in the bank then you can't do it this week Timothy in the chat good to see you mate how we doing how's the team looking who will win the Premier League Arsenal obviously obviously Arsenal who's winning the league guys well look let's do top four put your top four predictions in the chat in order Captain Saka Salah isako havs I would Captain Salah out those four City he winning the league leester imagine not again I don't know if I'll ever see a miracle like quite as crazy as Leicester winning the league again but we'll see Villa Champions Spurs Spurs to win the league you reckon I mean you as a Spur if you're a Spurs fan you can't be happy with the draw in gamei won that's a bad start to the season really should have won that one IP switch Arsenal City Liverpool then man united Arsenal City Liverpool Newcastle City Arsenal Liverpool Spurs Arsenal City Liverpool man united Arsenal City Liverpool Tottenham don't mind that one Arsenal City Liverpool Newcastle what are your thoughts on xery I tend not to take a chance on a player that's just joined the league early in the season I like to see them playing consistently in form before I really go there the vill of disrespect is crazy Will Anderson start today no he's uh not going to be well I doubt it he's not going to be in the Fulham Squad because he's finalizing his transfer to to uh sorry he's not going to be in the palace Squad cuz he's finalizing the move to Fulham so if he's still finalizing the move to Fulham then presumably he's not going to Wi in the Fulham Squad either so I'm guessing we don't see Anderson this week J or Diaz got to be J playing a striker I think it's the same price as Diaz as well they're both midfielders in FPL so yeah definitely jotter you guys want to see something crazy these are the uh game week two projected goals J is on the list by the he's in fifth place but look at this let me zoom out I mean is anyone tempted by triple Captain this week so Holland 1.34 projected goals 74% chance of getting one or more Salah on .75 projected goals 53% chance of getting one or more uh yeah jot is in fifth behind isak and foden as well Palmer's up there Sun Moon is on the list so again like good salanki replacement this week J Felix I don't know if he'll come straight in the 11 I'm trying to remember what he was like when he was UN loan before I feel like he wasn't a great FPL asset then but maybe he will be this time uh sacka Nicholas Jackson these are this assumes that the player starts and then you want to see an even crazier graphic these are the top season projected goals last season and this season and obviously the list is almost entirely harand but look at this so harand 1.34 projected goals is the highest or joint highest of this season and the entirety of last season but his Shar has gone up as well 40% so he'll have an expected 40% share in the goal so maybe that's cuz Alvarez has left or maybe because they're expecting foden to get less minutes that sort of thing The Joint Heist we've seen it last season and this season so it's really tempting it is really tempting but I don't I don't know if I'll do it John's in the chat John I remember last season we had this conversation before Fulham and you went for it you triple captained Harland against Fulham and you got a hattrick and an assist 20 points so you got 60 so are you doing it again John that's what I want to know if John's doing it back him all the way uh Devon thanks for the Super Chat he says um he missed game one his team is Edison Robertson Trent dunk vanen Bernardo Silva matoma Smith R Salah triple Captain Harland and isach and a benches fle and Lavia vestard Json any changes so I would take fleen down to a four mil keeper and then use the point five to upgrade vestard cuz your bench is way too light otherwise so this week playing Robertson Trent and vanderen I guess so yeah I would I would um downgrade fleen go V vestard to another point to a 4.5 M Defender I mean the rest is good I'm not so sure about Bernardo Silva but I do get it cuz it's a home fixture to I switch I would if it was me I would try and fit in foden over Bernardo if you can but obviously it's very hard cuz you do have Sal and harand so maybe maybe that's not possible actually no I think it's fine actually Salah and Harland and then you don't have B um fodm yeah Robertson's an interesting mind I was on the fantasy show yesterday and I actually said on that if I was wild card in this week I'd be really tempted to go Trent and Robertson cuz look at the next the fixtures three home games in the next four starting Game MC one we know what he's about like he's got an average of 10 attacking returns a season over the last six years Robertson so yeah if I if I was wild cun I'd be really tempted to go Robertson and Trent obviously the alternative as you go vardal but I don't mind the double up Robinson and Trent bit of a throwback that those of you that have played FPL for like five plus years or remember how good the Trenton Robo double up used to be uh but yeah no it's a good team it's a good team that's the only change I'd make to be honest and I agree with salar and salarin Holland on the wild card if I was wild carding I would have both as well I mean I'm potentially going to have both from gamei 4 I I was saying earlier I'm looking at doing something like Bruno to a 5.5 or isach to a 5.5 so someone like Min or or Xiao Pedro cuz that's when Brighton have got IP switch home Forest home and then that frees up the money for sacka to Salah and then in game week uh five is it yeah game we five Liverpool have got Bournemouth home and then Wolves Away which is where Man City have' got Arsenal home Newcastle way so you're also getting two better captains so I'd keep that in mind as well everyone CU I think that's probably a good path to go down because you're lining up really good captains obviously Captain Harland against Arsen Newcastle could work but you you'd back Salah wouldn't you over those two fixtures in isolation so John says we love Saturday mornings in Oscar I'm just trying to see did you answer about the triple Captain I might have missed your message there he's on Triple so John's going for it there's a few others there let me just someone said triple Captain locked in John Allen says I'm triple Captain him uh John's on Triple David YT David YouTube says triple Captain active he says not going to think it just go my gut feel him I meant to grab a screenshot from yesterday's video cuz I did discuss it and the um the slide was like really helpful maybe I can just take a screenshot of it now just to kind of break down the pros and cons of doing it this week let me just mute that so we don't hear the well welome back for another video hang on all right screenshot oh that's laggy so let's discuss the pros and cons of triple captain in this week uh there we go can you see that no so there's two expected double gami this season I'm just going down the bullets on the left now the bench booster three here and the triple Captain are all good chips to use in a double game week obviously the three is also usable in a blank gaming but that's potentially three chips for two double gamings plus we've got the mystery chip which is unnown we don't know like what the mystery Chip's going to do how it works whether that needs to be used in a double game week so therefore it might be the most effective week to use the triple captain and it is a less powerful chip than the bench boost in the threee here and then if we go back to the graphic earlier it's the highest projected goals we've seen last season and this season single match now Holland's six biggest Halles ever all came in home fixtures as well so there's a lot pointing towards it I'm not trying to sell you on it but I'm trying to like give you the pros and cons I I don't think I should do it cuz if I do like my decision before the the deadline stream was not to do it and it often doesn't go well if I make a decision during deadline streams so I think I should just stick to my guns and the counter to it is we're going to know what the mystery chip is after gamec 9 team and we'll have an idea of the doubles later in the season and in Game MC 30 man city are home to Leicester so that's another single gameing opportunity to use it harland's not injured for eight weeks I'm guessing you guys are fallen for the slow sports news tweet or you're trolling but yeah don't don't say that in chat he's not injured I think a lot I think a lot of people fall for that slow sports news I think it's from uh what they do they tweet news from like a year or ago or longer and like the jok is they've just tweeted something now like you know Aaron ramsdale to Bournemouth here we go that sort of thing anyway will doku start I'd imagine so cuz maybe saevinho doesn't get a start this time around I think pep said he's not quite at his 100% best yet so it might be a doku start yeah it could be we might see doku Fed de bruy and Bernardo all starting maybe I wouldn't count on it though I wouldn't like transfer him in he's one of those players like last season I remember he got 22 points in one match but then outside of that he's just so unpredictable for minutes and start so yeah I wouldn't be buying doku personally it's just too risky W says salanki to munes or salanki and am out for havs and Winks or someone else point five in the bank no I wouldn't take the hit just go salanki to munz wazer especially when you're taking a hit for someone like wink so you're not going to use anyway like hav is solid but for a minus four not really look at the next four Villa Brighton Tottenham Man City it's gamix six where I'll almost certainly buy him Leicester home Southampton home Bournemouth home I'll buy I'll almost certainly buy him there I might even be wild card in game 6 I think it's a good Wild Card window no triple Captain not active uh relo Amad start him if I'm honest it wouldn't surprise me if xery starts up top and rashford and garach are on the wings so I'd be reluctant and even if Amad starts he could come off before 60 like he's been coming off around the hour marker earlier so I wouldn't play him if I had him Captain vardo knock UL nah not Captain vardo surely you've got one of Salah and Harland who are better captains than vardal this week Armstrong or moones I'd go moones he's got slightly better fixtures two promoted teams in his next two as Watkins if that's who to start e Watkins is playing Arsenal E's home to West Ham so the poll was who you replacing salanki with 50% moones 16% Mata 10% Armstrong and 23 24% other so if anyone went other who's your other let us know in chat what R said he's he's on a fight from Seattle to Chicago and he's joining in for some deadline leaks the things FB managers do you're literally on the plane right now Ridge shout out to Ridge currently I don't know 20,000 ft in the air watching the deadline stream or he still on the plane not taken off yet yeah we'll have to see if we get any leaks cuz uh Man City have got the three o clock game so there is a chance that we get something there is a chance we get something about Man City so yeah anything we get in the bottom left corner we've got the uh leaks swidget starts and benched and I I basically just aggregate all the reliable leaks and like Chuck it down in the corner there so we did it last week and it went really well everything was 100% correct yeah I mean f there's a couple of City accounts there's FPL Tony there's FP Main Road although I saw Tony start on a patreon and he said some leaks is going to be exclusive in his patreon so that yeah I mean I don't know I feel like someone's going to sign up for it and leak the leaks I mean what do you guys think about that Bruno's getting a brace today hey you know what I hope so Stan did you see his post last week saying um I'm sorry to all fantasy managers out there for my performance in gami one I will repay you so yeah let's hope for a big game from Bruno this week who was top expected go involement gam 1 1.22 xgi absolute killer there was a couple of things like that which I think was super Unlucky gami One I went Bruno over jot cuz Bruno Bruno is a 90 minutes man he's on penalty set pieces but a fair play jot roners you definitely won gamei one and you might win gamei 2 this is the expected data widget from uh my site f. page completely free by the way uh yeah Bruno 1.22 xgi such also got the same but look at that Trent and thir third 1.06 crazy who's got the app by the way if anyone doesn't have it it's in the IOS app store search FPL focal and you'll see it there it's completely free who's been using it let me know in chat what you think of it it's been in the works for like a year uh and the Android one the the Android one's literally ready but Google an absolute pain you have to like submit for review and then they rejected that and I had to give them more information and then you have to go into two weeks of testing before you can um actually release it so yeah for now it's uh just in the IOS app store but it works in your browser as well so just go fb. page in your um on your phone virtual says add some ads I feel bad using it oh yeah so don't even get me started on uh how much it's costing me so last season I launched it at the start of last season and I was paying 40 Co a month and I was happy to just write that off as a loss cuz it's like a passion project but what I didn't anticipate is just how much more it would be used this season and now it's like 300 Quin a month so yeah I'm going to have to put ads on it I'm really sorry guys that was not ever the plan but like I'm not I'm not losing over three grand a year on a free FPL website so what I'll probably do is I'll have to put a few ads on it but I'll also have an option to like hide them or remove them for cheap so then you have a way to still have no ads that's probably what I'll have to do cuz that's the only option other other than closing it down and I don't want to do that uh so yeah what was I going to say yeah so last season right I thought so last season the entirety of last season 1.9 million there were 1.9 million hits and I thought that was insane but in a week I just realized my rank's wrong I'm not 5.1 mil it's done like 900,000 hits in a week so in in about two weeks it's going to have surpassed the entirety of last season so yeah um there's already like 45,000 users in the last week so it's pretty insane but obviously to have that many people on your website the hosting costs are like insane just going to update uh the live rank hang on uh I think I missed a few me oh Google yeah I know Google is such a pain in the ass honestly like I when I released it for um apple on Apple in the Apple Store they were like here you go go for it launch it mate and I did it Google are just an absolute pain yeah I did tweet the Android APK for those that want to s load it earlier you love the feature yeah that's that's one of my favorites oh are we still live or is it frozen is it just my stream oh I paused it whoops there we go yeah something like that like 150 and you get completely ad free maybe I'll have like some cool premium features like you can move the widgets around and like hide the ones you don't like or something I don't know but yeah I I have to add ads annoying that was never the plan but I'm not I'm not paying free grand out of pocket like on a a f website I was happy losing like 500 quid last season but it's gone way up Rees dearis best striker in pro clubs history a thousand goals Newton 2 it's good to see my boys from my pro clubs in the chat anyone else play fc24 I play with a few boys um in pro clubs and uh yeah I hit a th goals for the club a few weeks ago so massive Milestone PCH says nice stream focal watching from the shower watching from the shower where's everyone watching from should I ask this again Ask time A lot of people are like I'm watching on the toilet right now in fact take a photo unless you're on the toilet or the shower of wherever you're watching from like your living room or like in your car show me a stream setup and I'll retweet it unless you're in the toilet bar shower something like that then I won't and I don't want to be tagged in that but otherwise tag me on Twitter let me catch up on chat only Mo thanks for the 32 months he says what's up Legend start two of Inu coner and bergal I would start Inu give him another chance like I don't know if you guys saw the quote from aresca on Netto but he said um cuz he used Netto in Europa conference league and I think he played 90 moresa said he hasn't played 90 since February and to use him again on Sunday is asking too much so that's one less player potentially competing with minutes for him and aunu came off like 57 minutes or something 58 minutes so um definitely in kungu I'm giving him another chance you're about to have a shower John's watching him from the office Graham's having his lunch watching him from the sofa in Flight I can't believe you're actually watching flight that's so cool are you getting ripped off with the flight Wi-Fi hey it's worth it you're tuning into the deadline stream I've never done that you know I normally just download loads of stuff to watch offline on flights but like if the costs were ever reasonable I wouldn't be opposed to getting Wii while on the flight watching from a SAA no way no way living room Scotland bed Bangladesh watching from China watching at the gym watching from Mars no way what's the signal like there didn't think that was good Wi-Fi uh C Max Spud thanks for the Super Chat he says he's torn on hooa bench between Sakura and in kunu he's a villa fan so he doesn't really want to cheer on an Arsenal player do I go with my heart or brain I would go with your brain if I'm honest I know it feels dirty but sometimes in FPL you got to separate your heart and brain like if if I felt that I'm an Arsenal fan right if I felt the best Captain this week was someone playing Arsenal I would go for it like I wouldn't feel proud of it if it came off but you have to just separate the two sometimes otherwise you could leave yourself with worse points but I suppose it depends on how serious you're playing like if you're not like massively serious you don't really care then um then I understand it like starting the other but you might be putting yourself in a position to score less points so what matters more to you basically like again I was talking about my mates I play pro clubs with one of them sold um havit oh my God that this story is actually crazy so he's new to fpl this season right and he's been giving out all week in the group chat like cuz he scored more points than me in game m one he's been giving out giv out non-stop abuse in the group chat for out scoring me and he sold havocs for salanki like back on Monday cuz he's a villa fan so he didn't want to have havit playing against his team so he sold havit for salanki and then obviously rang me yesterday like oh my God salanki is injured I'm fuming and I was like oh oh what a shame I'm really sorry mate that sucks for your team but yeah I I wouldn't I would separate the two I wouldn't I would separate the two when it comes to fpl I'm guessing most of you do the same uh Dylan wants a triple Captain pole yeah let's do that are you going for it Dylan there's your triple Captain active the poll is up would you ever get the focal tattoo I would yeah so at 200,000 subscribers I'm I am getting it I'm pretty nervous about it cuz I don't have any tattoos I've never got one before but the agreement was if we get 200,000 subscribers I will get the focal logo tattooed so yeah if you're not subscribed hit that button below it's completely free you can always change your mind like once we hit 200,000 you can just be like I'm I'm subscribing now he's got the tattoo but that is the deal so uh yeah hit subscribe get involved yeah triple Captain poers up to get your votes in right let's um what should we do should we look at Kings of the game week and play that or should we look at the scout selection which one should we do first gami one's King of the game was a bit of a boring one wasn't it Salah I think a lot of people got it last week it's normally a random player just for sneak says love your content focal subscriber for Life appreciate that thank you very much yeah the last like month's been insane in terms of the channel growth like I've said this to a few other content creators if I would do this for like pennies and I would do if it stayed like this forever I'd be happy I'd do this minimum wage like the fact that the channel is still growing like blows my mind and I feel like really lucky to just be doing this full time now it's it's like beyond my wildest dreams when I start this channel I was streaming to one guy for weeks and I never thought it'd become anything it was just cuz I loved FPL and it was a hobby so it's kind of like Mentor really how the last few years have played out loc Ono subscribed two years ago appreciate it morning morning el padrino el padrino I think was one of my first ever subscribers I'm pretty sure I'm pretty sure he subscri when I had less than 100 I'm pretty sure yeah you got everyone start somewhere someone messaged me last night actually saying um I'm thinking about starting a channel uh have you got any tips and I sent him like a really long reply just giving him all the sort of tips to start a channel and I'd recommend anyone gives it a go cuz I never expected anything to become of the channel it was just like for fun so you never know what could happen and I thought I was way too late as well starting um Dan 86 thanks so much for becoming a member as well thank you very much Dan Danny 88 86 uh if anyone else wants to become a member use the join button below the stream yeah it's crazy your camera shy I don't go on camera in my video it's just the deadline streams but I yeah it's it's a bit different actually how I do my content cuz I don't go in videos and I think most channels do I think number one it saves me having to look present for videos and number two it's like more focused on the content rather than the person but that's not necessarily a good thing I think I think the downside is sometimes you uh you don't get as much as a personal connection with them if you're not seeing them every video so yeah there are pros and cons to it I think that's a big thing on YouTube as well like you're investing into the person that you're watching which is harder to do if you can't see them in video but anyway have you heard of let's talk FPL never heard of him yeah of course I have he's like the goat of FPL YouTube he's the biggest Channel who hasn't heard of him like I watched I watched him for a couple of years before I started doing videos and then like 30 years later not 298,000 absolutely crazy and now I've got my own app in the app store what is life good to see Robert in the chat FP yellow Army how you doing mate right anyway let's uh let's do kings of the game Guess is in the chat who's going to be the top scorer of game 2 it was Mo Salah game one 14 points get your guesses in who's it going to be this week while I catch up on super chats Milkman so he says hi mate um Gordon for foden or KD B no Harland team if I was selling Gordon it' be foden not KD B yeah if you like really want a piece of that man city attack I'd go fod him Gordon to fod him he'll get more minutes this season 100% it it could go out the way don't get me wrong like de BR could absolutely tear it up but over the season you'd quite confidently say foden gets more minutes I'd go fodm Kemp kny does guess fodm Robinson Anthony Isaak viio Harland Harland harland's a brave guess wow Starling and brave to guess harland's top scorer I mean it it could well be to be fair Lewis LS is a fun shot a a gundan I don't know if he'll play this week week yeah g went back to City 6.5 mil I think he is Howard Bellis or Lewis Hall I'd start Lewis Hall skip MO is two goals and an assist you reckon hope not unless uh Smith row is involved then I'll take it because I've got Smith row not munes munz Armstrong havs Bruno Fernandez it's it's pronounced Bruno Fernand isn't it I always call him Fernand is but it's fange isn't it that's the actual way you meant to pronounce his name all right we'll have to check in and see how we got on next week very predictable one game at one it's normally it is normally like someone really random that gets King of the game week like dku will get suddenly get a hat trick out of nowhere and he's not in anyone's team really Maguire it's Fernandez I thought it was fernan fernan fernan like yeah like Jerry said it with a J no cuz they did a video the other day like players pronouncing how to say their name and that was how he said it in that do a discussion on Triple Captain well this is uh from a sludge from yesterday's video in a nutshell there's two expected double gamings this season cuz they've changed the FA Cup schedule so there's less doubles this season than we've had in past Seasons which is a shame for FPL but that's how it is now the bench boost free hit and triple Captain they're all good in double game weeks free obviously can use in in a blank game week as well and then we've got the mystery chip as well which may or may not be good in a double game week so that's like potentially four chips for two double game weeks maybe three maybe two if the free hit is better in a blank and the Mystery chip Works in a single so they thought it may or may not be the most effective week to use the triple Captain Which is less powerful than the bench boost and three here so I don't hate it at all and then you look at the goal score projections this week it's like harland's so far in front 1.34 projected goals he's got 74% chance of scoring one or more and then this graphic from Rob tfpl showing the highest single game at Gold projections that we've seen last season and this season and Harland this week is joint top with 1.34 projected goals so that's that's the logic to using it in a nutshell so the poll's active let's see what the results are saying anyway 75% aren't using it 25% are 25% so one in four of you watching right now a triple Captain him I'm is anyone not is anyone triple Captain him but not Harland I guess I should ask that as well Hilty says it's my first season of FPL and I'm addicted it's a really addictive game isn't it and the thing is right if FPL didn't existed you'd never care like if Smith row scores against Leicester but like suddenly I'm super invested in that game cuz I want Smith row to do well for me so it does make the weekends like really exciting FPL cuz you've got games on throughout the season uh throughout the weekend and throughout the season you know you got nine months of weekends where there's loads to be excited about throughout the weekends and obviously there's midweek games as well so yeah I mean who's addicted to fpr I guess everyone is right we all are yeah it's a good game and it's um still growing every season this season a record number of teams were entered at game one MK 47 thanks very much for becoming a member and thanks again to Dan 86 oh I missed earlier uh Abdul Jalil gifted one membership sorry I missed that if you're still here apologies um thanks very much for that gifted membership uh and yeah thanks to Devon as well the

calls me oosi he's even got a nickname for me anyway let's unbox it here it is need to be careful not to leak my address I'll give five memberships anyway so we'll see uh we'll see who gets those cuz no one was ever going to guess this if it's what I think is so this is this is this is literally the worst unboxing in YouTube history that you're watching before your eyes I'm not even joking worst unboxing YouTube history here we go it is soil one of my one of my plants is dying and it needs soil so I ordered soil you just witnessed YouTube history though the worst I'm going to have to get in touch with Google World Records the worst unboxing in YouTube history well wasy so yeah that's what it was it was soil soil unboxing YouTube history though the worst unboxing ever thank you all for being part of this massive piece of YouTube history the soil unboxings um yeah thanks again um Mac 47 for becoming a member and Dallas Maddie as well for becoming a member and Mac again for the 10 gifted so if you got one of those make sure you're thanking I'm going to drop five gifteds in the chat as well so let's see who gets those to get them you have to just chat in chat I guess and then it does it randomly so if anyone's messaged in chat today then you've got a chance to get these so here we go chat chat chat people are like now chatting who got one Michael Sia British guyo I didn't see who got the rest so yeah I'm going to repot a plant today what a day make some mer I actually did make some but I've never like advertised it it might be on my channel I think if you go to my channel then press store there are like actually um just like t-s with a little focal logo it's not like cringy FPL shirts like a shirt that's got a captain Harland or something on it it's just like a little focal logo it's actually quite nice um also like this is so cool when my girlfriend stays over she often wears the focal t-shirt I was like oh my God I'm the luckiest man ever she's wearing my brand t-shirt right I think I missed the couple of super chats um Kemp says focal let's go triple Captain Harland and laugh all day hey good luck to you I hope it comes off I just don't think I should change my mind in the deadline stream it tends to go wrong if I change my mind or something during a deadline stream so I'm not going to I'm going to leave it it might be a mistake to not use it now like for those reasons we were talking about earlier if anyone missed that we did a little slide on Triple captaincy pros and cons so rewind to that if you um didn't see that bit joean says bench one up Robinson Murphy and Rico Lewis oh that's tricky I'd start Lewis you've got to start Lewis for the upside against ipswitch home like he was playing so Advanced last match like a cam I did it I did it in the experts video kind of talked about the Tactical setup and it was like a 316 in attack like a flat six at the front and I don't know if you guys remember but for harland's goal the bill the ball got draw I get my words out today the ball got drilled across and Bernardo stuck a leg out and that like redirected it unintentionally to Harland I don't think he meant it it was Ric Lewis that was on the edge of the box ready to receive that to take a shot and those are the sort of areas he was popping up him so I feel like you bench Robinson here which sounds crazy but you got to chase the upside of Murphy I think like it's a Winger versus a Defender I'd chase the upside of Murphy like he was unlucky to get hooked last match that was the red card nothing else Sida says hi any news on fod and starting love the work um I'll check if we had any leaks I don't think we will have had any yet I mean we've got like an hour or so till the deadline so we might get something a bit nearer yeah nothing at the moment I'll keep an out like anything we get it will be added to the bottom left corner straight away so you'll know if there's any leaks on who starts who doesn't and so on uh Mark schroer says Anderson move means I've got four full in my team he's got Smith R Leno bender and Anderson will I be forced to you to transfer to move one of them on yeah you will I think a few people reply to you there but yeah if you've got four players from one team after a transfer happens then you can't transfer anyone out until you get rid of those four that fourth player first so yeah you're going to have to make a transfer there to sell one of your fillm players before it lets you do anything else has anyone ever had four players from a team before what does the bottom left box mean on the overlay so that's basically a leaks widget so if there's a leak that someone starts it will go in that starts box or if there's a leak that someone's benched they'll go on the bench so let's say I don't know an hour from now we start getting leaks before the deadline and we hear like Harland and foden starts uh I don't know like Walker doesn't Lewis starts then those are going those boxes accordingly so it's just a good way to like pull together all the reliable leaks that we've had cuz there's a lot of like fake stuff that goes around especially near deadlines to try and cause last minute panic so yeah it's just it's just a good way to have everything Central that you can have reasonable confidence in that it's going to be right it's never 100% the leaks but there's lots of accounts that are actually really reliable of a proven record so yeah that's what that's for basically and the other thing I've added is um the team news now which rotates in with the expert's captaincy so experts captaincy is the data from the expert Series in terms of who the top alltime managers are going for for this week and then yeah every like 20 seconds or something the team news headlines comes over like it like it did just them suly Breezy thanks for the Super Chat Alex Murray says Will Murphy and Hall play Oscar love the content I reckon they probably will like Hall didn't have a great game but Shar got the red card so You' you'd think he's probably all right maybe it' be like burn and Kelly Center back or would craft come in but my best guess is they'll both play Murphy came off early which was um again just because of the red card and you'd imagine he gets another start cuz it wasn't his fault the red card and it was harsh that he had to be hooked early but someone had to come off cuz they were down to 10 men and it was Murphy do you think Quan might play I hate to say it but I think he probably won't so he was hooked at halim obviously gami one and Slot said he he was losing some Jewels um and then slot said he picked up a bit of an injury on Tuesday this week uh and he missed Wednesday's training session and then slot said yesterday morning let's see if he can train today uh and I believe he did train yesterday but I don't know it just feels like a lot's pointing towards a canate start so I've benched him personally Ely it's really annoying I just needed qu to play two games but he made it to No.5 games so yeah I've ended up start starting dunk and I've even put quer ahead of qua but yeah I mean it's very unlikely but if we get something before the deadline then um yeah I'll let you know and I'll update the bottom left widget but they don't play till tomorrow evening so it's like quite far away it's very unlikely suly Breezy says do you think Amad will play today with the news of his mom passing oh I didn't know about that sorry to hear about that uh that's devastating wow probably not I mean that's yeah that's devastating news I'd be surprised I mean everyone's different aren't they in terms of how they react to this stuff some people say is I'm going to go out there and do them proud some people need to mourn for weeks or months you know everyone's different so I'd be speculating but I mean even before you that message I said at the start of the stream I wouldn't be surprised if it's xery rashford and garat chos the front three so my best guess is no he doesn't play yeah well it doesn't matter biological or not it's his mom I get that's who raised him right anyway besides the point it's devastating news and he's going to be really upset isn't he so yeah that's horrible to hear and and I'd imagine he's imagine he's not involved if that's just happened um JK JP K says hall or Pedro to St focal the man I feel like you have to start the striker here yeah I would start Shia Pedro home fixture Striker on penalties I would start Shia Pedro Yan klopp says bench Smith r or Inu and my third spot in defense is between Quan Bar M Leno obviously a place to be where to go with this he says so I'd bench and kungu I'd start Smith row he's got the own fixture better fixture they might get similar minutes to be fair but i' would say Smith row so the third spot in defense it's got to be it's got to be mikeno isn't it I mean bco won't play K Quanza probably doesn't start so it has to be mikeno yeah Sam Andrew says thought Adam Armstrong yeah we're talking about him earlier in terms of Sania Replacements he'd be in my top three I'd go probably munes mateta and then Armstrong I think all three are are solid picks uh yeah I think he's good home fixure to Forest this week he's on penalties so um yeah I think he's a good pick Armstrong garyan Jonathan uh says Almer on transfer or trust he plays today no he won't play today I mean is he even at Newcastle still I thought he'd left or he's being sold no get rid of him he won't play I'll always remember his Purple Patch though where he was scoring for fun for like a month and then he went back to normality that was good fun I had him for that but no he won't start start munis or Smith row oh I mean they're literally dead even flip a coin I suppose go with a striker oh okay siblings mom I mean I don't know I'll be speculating I don't know the relationship between the two of them but who knows M starts is there a leak already on that where are you seeing that I haven't seen anything on uh man united yet Michael Lucy says mike kevi start up top for Spurs now salanki is out yeah it's going to go two of ways so salanki is out minimum one one week it might be two game weeks so richison or kulesi now richison missed preseason because he had an injury kisi was starting up top before they signed sanki and he was really good in preseason but it's I'd say it's pretty 50/50 who he starts I reckon it might be richison if I had to guess to be honest domic War say start Xiao Pedro or in kungu love the content mate I would start jaia Pedro he should get more minutes he's on penalties home fixture I'd go Xiao Pedro all right let's have a look at the scout selection let me know in chat how many players you've got from the Scout the team this week is Ry and go Trent vardo Muno Palmer J E Smith Harland havs and wood uh including the bench as well which is Val the Maron Winks Howard Bellis and Davies how many of you guys got so I've got Trent E Smith row Harland four am I mudded I've only got four I don't know quite a lot of you have got four one two only four three two okay start has got seven wait I've got five including valder Marson if we can count that four okay not only people have got that many Michael's also got seven looking good with seven hey OSI should I play Anderson or Howard Bellis Anderson might not play yeah he's not going to be in the um the palace Squad cuz he's finalizing the move to Fulham so he'd imagine he doesn't play for Fulham either if he's finalizing the move still so Howard Bellis right is an interesting picking goal I don't see why they didn't just go for uh Edison with the home fixture but there we go yeah Quan might get minutes late on that's the thing if he doesn't start you'd expect him not to to be honest realistically now especially after that news of the injury on Tuesday even if we did train yesterday por ardio already wild carded well the thing is it's the last good fixure for parro for three weeks so is it really worth it I think I'd just go vardal because he's got three good games yeah fing should start I reckon we'll get some news near the deadline as well some leaks but I would say he starts here 45 minutes in gamei one Off the Bench so you think he probably starts maybe svino doesn't start this one as well are you playing playing challenge this year yeah I am um official fpo actually asked me to do an article on this week's challenge which I did annoyingly I wrote the whole thing up and I had sankian and then they messaged me last minute yesterday like uh who are you replacing salanki with so I quickly like changed it to richison I'm guessing they published that article already um but yeah I've done a team I haven't got League or anything but yeah I I'll play it parro or Robinson parro definitely parro I think Spurs should win this one fairly comfortably cuz Everton right they've got branway out Young's suspended red card they've got Pat and Coleman also out on right back and then taros is also a major doubt for the game so they've got five Defenders out so yeah it's really un lucky for sank owners cuz this could have been a proper solanki game and that's just FPL in it there's a level of skill but there's also a massive level of luck what percentage would you put level what percentage would you put luck and skill let me let us know in chat so like would you say 50% skill 50% luck or 75% skill 25% luck what would you have it as FPL in its entirety or would you say it's very little skill and all Lu Michael says in kungu to doku I'm worried cuz he played UAA I love you I love you too Michael um no I feel like that's a it's one of those like dku could start and absolutely tear it up but he's so risky for minutes that I wouldn't I personally wouldn't transfer doku in he's not even guaranteed to start this one he probably does but the fact that anunu played about 58 came off early says to me he's in line for another start so I would leave that one personally it's not a move I would ever make uh F bitman Marcus in the chat he came 2.8k last season he says it's 99% luck um bazer reckons it's 50/50 F dation says 80% luck 20% skill MAA says 75% skill 25% luck oh we'll end that poll as well that's been up for a while thanks forever spanning spam in the uh in the bottom righte on chat the hearts thing it never seems to stop animating that I don't is someone does someone sit there for 2 hours clicking it like people taking it in turns what's going on there cuz it goes nonstop the entire stream but yeah anyway thank you for whoever's doing that 10% luck 20% skill 15% concentrated power of Will and 40 That's 45% so yeah what 55% bad math as well it's good when worth bringing in for for 6.5 mil nah not for me not for me I he'd need to start loads of games consistently and hit some serious form for me to consider going there I did own him once upon a time he hit that purple patch or form where he scored like 12 goals in 13 games 70% Twitter scrolling should we sell Barco if you've got Barco and you've got defense you can play then just leave it just leave it cuz it's it's just a needless transfer if you literally don't have a defense you've only got two Defenders at start then yeah then I'd sell him cuz if you can roll this week then on paper there's way more upside moves in gamei two and uh gamei three and four with you know a couple of free transfers or even three now that we can have up to five as opposed to buying you know a four Mill Defender or a 4.5 more Defender but I know everyone's different some people wanted to avoid the Quan prise fall some people did that as well but I decided to roll this week and just take a chance that there's something more exciting I can do like I might buy Salah in game four you know I could do something like this shall uh like isak to Xiao Pedro sacka to Salah and gami four so that would be here and then I've got Salah Captain for Forest uh Forest Home Bourn of Home Wolves Away i' probably Captain harand still gami four actually cuz he's brenford home but then harland's got Arsenal home Newcastle away so that's one possible route I'm considering sorry we're back OBS froze for a sec there we're back we're back um sir Ian says harand triple Captain why own him if you're not willing to Triple Captain well you can own him and triple Captain him in a double game later in the season that's the thing but we were talking about it earlier and there's only going to be two expected double game weeks we could have more if there's an unexpected payment but there's two expected doubles and we've got three hit Triple Captain bench boost and the Mystery chip so yeah there is logic to using it now but you you can still triple captain in harand later in the season in a double game week or you can still use it in a single game week like game week 30 when we know what the mystery chip is so it it's really close and I think it's it's really like genuinely viable this week and we did a poll earlier 25% are going for it is bco price locked yeah he's flagged now so his price is locked bco won't go down in price if you had the bench dep would you bench shanki to go for Watkins next week I would yeah yeah I I would much rather get Watkins next week than going down to like a cheaper forward now and then blocking myself from Watkins gamei 3 is rodri defitely not playing well pep said he doesn't expect him to be involved so almost certainly not might make the bench but it sounds like he definitely w't be starting so yeah yeah B's B's gone I'm pretty sure he's flagged in fpo isn't he someone let me know is he is he red flagged Champions League fantasy's out I don't know if I'll do Champions League fantasy content again I did one for my gamei one team but then there was like such little interest after the first uh whatever you call it first game we I guess I think it's called something different on Champions League fantasy it just wasn't worth all the time to edit and record and research so I might play it but just not do content it is good fun though um cfj W says start hall or Rogers I would start Hall up between those two I mean Rogers against the best defense in the league last season Arsenal so I'd start Hall uh IC says start Louis hall or Muno great content I'd start Munoz in that case yeah I mean he's got the home fixture equally attacking yeah I'd go Muno boss huxley's brought and vardy yeah so what transfers has everyone made this week those of you that have made one what transfers did you guys make I'm going to roll this week decided to just ride out the quano price for but we'll see hopefully in gamec three or four that'll give me something more exciting to do with extra transfers British brought m in Mark went Quan to Hall such or xia Pedro in I prefer xia Pedro definitely luk went salanki to munes I think quite a few did that John did the same salanki to Harland what how have you done that then you have 7 and a half mil on the bank and game one or have you like sold Salah for a hit quaner to Robinson yeah I think that's probably one of the most popular Moves In fact do you guys can you guys guess who the most transferred in player is this week and then we'll have a look who actually the most transferred in players are who's the most transferred in player Matson to Robinson yeah Bar's gone so he's price locked Antonio that's a bold one they just signed F Krug well Beck J mazeri Robinson the answer was yeah a lot of you got it Maz R is the most TR with him let's update his numbers 476,000 transfers in but this is classic FBO like someone hold in G one that no one was looking at and then everyone rushes to buy him even though if you ask me there's a lot of 4.5s that make more sense than Maui I mean could carry on smashing it but there's other ones I would have looked at before him you reckon it's just United fans I think it's a mixture there's a lot of people that see the the hall last week or whatever he got not Hall his points last week and buy him havs in second J mun I was trying to see if salanki was there anyone know how many transfers in sank had this week can someone check that and let us know I reckon there was a lot of transfers in for salanki before I mean my mate I was telling you about earlier that I played pro clubs with did hav to salanki like on Monday and they rang me absolutely fuming yesterday uh who else is up there m harand 262,000 I reckon he's going up tonight is he not 15.1 mil we're going to see another record for the most expensive price in FB history what's Harland at right now in terms of price Rises yeah 10.5% salah's going up as well Welbeck looks like he's going up interesting 143,50 66 transfers in for salanki Oh my days that's brutal this this is why by the way I understand sometimes if there's price Rises you have to go for it but there was no reason to like buy salanki early it wasn't going up was he as far as I'm way it was nowhere near a price rise it's a lesson that like you do learn the the painful way like when you're new to fpl wait until as late as possible to make transfers unless you really want to catch a price rise or if there's an 0.2 mil swing that sort of thing but yeah more often not the sensible play is just wait for the press conferences because then you're making a decision with the most possible information available to you at the time cuz yeah when you make that transfer like on Monday like my mate did it's just like complete unknown what news you might not be aware of until the Friday presses uh in terms of most sold players then 925,000 have sold to lanky uh Watkins in second I feel like if I Watkins I'd keep him at this point cuz game week three the fixtures are great Tony's in third trippier bco there he is Palmer go again like Palmer surely you just give him another week like he's just played Man City what were you expecting golden rodri e e as well like honestly some of these I would not be selling e personally isak like he got an assist and they were 10 down to 10 men Quan yeah fair enough foden like who's selling foden who is selling foden this week before IP switch home like what is going on here Pedro porro again like this is why you wait for the presses po I'm going mad here I'm losing the plot seeing the most transferred out players pedar is fit like he's fine to play and he just scored last game we and he's home to Everton who are Bare Bones defense you love the outrage thanks Marcus oh man every week there's some there that are like what is going on with these most trans with players oosy outrage that should be a segment every week the osy outrage segment um where did I get to official Smitty thanks for the Super Chat he says I panicked and I swapped salanki vardi bad move uh not necessarily not necessarily like scored in gami one they didn't really have many chances did they but it's a better fixture this week I prefer Armstrong for the same price but I don't know it's a bit of a nostalgic pick isn't it bardy the thing is Dak is out injured still Canon's not in the picture so like and they haven't got signed a striker yet so he's the only Striker right now I feel a bit bad for anyone that went madidi cuz he was playing up top in preseason and vardy was like meant to be out for the game so some people went madidi as an out of position five and a half mil mid and then he was benched I don't know if that was Cooper just sending the message to the board like you need to sign a striker right now but yeah VY St started so you guys see what he did to Spurs as he was going off point pointing at his Premier League Crest and and saying like I've got one you've got none do you think the Smith row moon is double up is too risky uh not necessarily it's a little bit risky but they've got the fixtures for it to be a reasonable risk to take yeah that's a good point I'm surprised they didn't sign Ina yeah good point maybe he's out of budget I don't know now chriswood is not a bad shout it's just like like we was saying intia might go to Forest or is that one done already I don't know does anyone know if Ina is actually a done n have we had the here we go yet from fabito so there's that and then there's also aani he's in the picture wood will start again it's just um like if they've got fre Strikers it feels a little bit riskier than some of like moon is where it's just him versus himz if that makes sense but yeah he's not a bad pick and also like two home two games against two promote teams next for Fulham that's why I'd say I like him more even though Moonis did blank G one but they're both okay they're both good picks and black Finch says triple Captain Harem this week I'm feeling Reckless it's not Reckless it's genuinely not Reckless we did a poll earlier 25% to going for it and as I was saying earlier we've got the triple Captain bench boost free hit and mystery chip but we're expected to have two double game weeks we don't know what the mystery chip is so maybe it doesn't work in a double it might only be for singles it could be like your single game forward score double we don't know what it is but it could be four chips for two doubles obviously free hit can work in a blank as well so there is logic to using it now and this graphic we pulled up earlier last season and this season it's the highest projected goals for a single player in a single match and actually it's top in terms of project uh percentage share so harland's on 1.34 projected goals this week and a 40% share among the goals so like last season we did have uh 1.34 as well when he was home to loton that was 38% share uh I wonder if I can quickly find this graphic as well on Holland's biggest tools yeah here it was that's Holland's six biggest Halls ever and you notice a trend there all six are those home games so you got hatrick two assists against man united 23 points 21 points 20 17 17 17 all home games what is interesting is we've not seen him put up a a hall here against a promoter team so maybe it's those mid-table teams that he does best against so like your walls your fuls Palace Etc but I mean you can't argue it really can you I I do get it I do get it triple Captain I don't hate it at all the re the only reason I said I might save it is you can wait till another single game week like leester home gami 30 and we'll know what the mystery chip is then and we'll have an idea of the double gameing as well why didn't you do Euro fantasy I had a few holidays in the summer I went to Glaston B Festival uh had a mates wedding I went to Wales I did a few holidays basically I couldn't commit to it I thought i' just take the summer off as well like I'm glad I did cuz I came back seeing feeling like so recharged in Pre season that I was able to like go harder than I've done in any other preseason and it paid off to be fair like the content was better than any other season in my opinion and the views were better than any other preseason as well so I'm glad I took a break otherwise you're just making content all year round so yeah it a combination of reasons really the glasto Vlog was great by the way thanks very much yeah that's on the secret channel the secret glasto Channel that I I made I don't ever plan to monetize that channel it's just like a fun thing to put together during the offseason that's how I like to spend the breaks instead do like a glasto vlog I think it's got like 10,000 views which is like pretty insane for a channel that's got no subscribers and that I never advertised uh to my actual FPL audience so yeah the algorithm picked that one up which is pretty cool Matthew D says son to fod and thoughts love the content mate ah it's a difficult good one though isn't it cuz I know fod is home to whip switch how many minutes does he get could play 90 could play like 70 sun should play about 90 but Everton are missing Bram fight Young's got a red card and the other right backs Patterson and Coleman also injured now taros is like a major doubt for the game so they've got five Defenders out so for me and let's pull up the projected points for this week for me that feels like you're making a transfer for a player that's a bit of a sideways move I mean look here so 6.7 projected points for some with an 88 Minutes on FP review uh foden 6.6 with 77 estima minutes so on paper that's sideways that transfer so would you would you Haven want to make a transfer transfer where you think there's a serious chance here the player I'm selling out score who I'm buying obviously with hindsight what I'm saying like could look completely wrong and foden could smash it and Sun blanks but I just think I would never make that move this week as tempting as it is espe I mean if if you don't have Harland and you you're desperate for a slice of City's attack then I can understand it I can understand it for from that perspective to kind of hopefully protect yourself a bit against whatever City doe to wh switch in fact we need to do the predictions let's rattle through those real quick Brighton V man united put your guesses in the chat and which team you're guessing for Brighton V man united uh let me take slow mode off real quick so everyone can get involved customization slow mode disable guess is in the chat Brighton be man united and put which game you're guessing for cuz we're going to Rattle through these fast uh 2-0 21 to Brighton two all one0 a draw two all quite a few saying two all you reck him all right we'll go to all Crystal Palace V West Ham guess is in the chat make sure you uh mention the team so I know which one you're guessing for Palace V West Ham slow mode is off so get your guesses in Palace V West Ham what are we saying for this one is e if there's any justice in this world e get something this game after having that free kick rolled out game one incorrectly cuz the the ref blew too early 20 again 3-2 to West Ham 2-0 Palace I reckon two all yeah let's go with that Fulham V Leicester city so a lot of you have got Smith Roy Moon Mo owners or Mo owners Robinson owners probably want a clean sh here what we saying F and be Leicester leester manag to score against Spurs are they going to do it again against Fulham what are we saying 2-1 2 nil 2 21 21 21 Man City versus IP switch Man City versus it switch what are we saying for this one one0 what do you mean Edo one0 3 n to City 10 n to City 5 n 5 N A lot of people saying 5 nil I'm actually going to genuinely put that in there might be a bit bold but let's see Southampton be Forest what we saying Southampton be Forest guess is in the chat slow Mode's off so get involved while we got slow mode off not such an exciting one this one but I know there's lots of you that got wood some of you got Hudson ad do Langer hard Bellis Armstrong two1 to forest two1 forest okay Spurs v Everton how are Spurs going to do about salanki richardis up top probably is parro going to score again or is he going to get assist 3 nil Spurs 3-0 3 okay 3-0 Aston Villa versus Arsenal huge one Villa got the better of them last season my gut feeling is they might struggle to get the better of them this time round they've not look quite as good Watkins hasn't had a pre-season what are we saying two new Arsenal three2 Arsenal two all draw one new Arsenal 2-1 Villa 21 to Arsenal Bournemouth versus Newcastle just a few left to do get involved slow modes off so Chuck your guesses in bouri Newcastle what we saying 4-0 Newcastle you right reckon you reckon they'll win that comfortably 4-1 3-0 2 nil Newcastle I mean they haven't got salanki we know that much does Evan nilson come straight in or is it like seeno up top 2-1 okay not really clean sheets predicted here wsv Chelsea then what we saying for this one lots of anunu hopeful owners in the chat uh myself in included by the way can Inu deliver or is he going to blank again and dropped down to 64 he needs to return this week or he's he's looking at a price drop wols V Chelsea what we saying 2-0 Chelsea 1-0 wolves 3-1 walls 2-0 Chelsea 21 Chelsea 21 Chelsea all right last one Liverpool be brenford huge game for those that have got Salah and not Harland he just needs to match Harland can he do it if if you've got Salah and Harland then you're absolutely laughing this week no stress Salah red card no chance 21 Liverpool 3-1 3-0 Liverpool 3-0 Liverpool all right there we go we're done so our starting rank was 55 not bad let's see how we get on next week and uh thanks for the guesses do we need slow mode back on let's see how chat goes uh right I think I missed was there some leaks while we were doing that let me check what does that mean oh no we still got what 40 minutes 38 minutes to the deadline so we keep keep an eye uh I'll quickly catch up on a couple of super chats I missed there um so it was Rosa he says start to bench one Smith row and kungu Xiao Pedro I would start Smith row and Xiao Pedro I think yeah cuz it wouldn't surprise me if whenu gets about an hour again Smith R I'd like to think gets a little bit more and he's got a better fixture Chia Pedro home to man united on penalties I think that makes the most sense and shock says Hey Fulk dude sanky out for moon is Mata or wood I would say moon is um out of those three home to Leicester and then away IP switch and then home to West Ham it's a quite a nice block of three games so yeah I would just Chuck munes in if I had him if I had salanki it makes the most sense to me uh right what was it on 30 seconds SS or Rah I would say Rya I mean what's the clean odds saying must be close Arsenal 34% chance Forest 27 yeah Rya start ryer oh yeah we need to do a captain poll we've not actually done one I suppose it's going to be a pretty one-sided one this week who is your captain so what we have Salah Harland who would be the other one son another if you go other message in chat those are the three options or the four options the poll is up get your votes in did you guys see the players League by the way on FPL page Andy Robertson 81 points he got in gamei one the captain Salah you want to see salah's FPL team Salah Captain Salah scenes that's salah's FPL team he went triple Arsenal defense oh yeah bco even Salah fell into the Barco trap no way even Salah fell for the Barco trap and he had Tony but he had yeah he had a great team so Salah Captain himself he had jotter Robertson so obviously he knew that Robertson was starting uh yeah and he had triple Arsenal defense he went Ry white Gabrielle and he had a Ki as well he absolutely smashed it Salah crazy who else did well Andy Carroll 75 points trippier got 73 uh did you see willix Team this was Will's team so he bench boosted and his bench got zero points he bench boosted himself and he didn't play like what I can't even imagine like the banter and the Newcastle group chat cuz they're in a mini league together the Newcastle players he bench boosted zero points gami one uh Trent did all right managed to find uh like the harland's circle of acquaintances like they're all in FPL so who remembers last season when they all sold Harland before the news of his leak was P um his injury was public so anyway FPL do page uh we've got 2,400 tuned in if you've enjoyed the stream

your YouTube account you'll see the members Channel automatically where I'm I'm online chatting every day and uh there's the members League uh and it supports a channel so join button below if you want to be a member as well um y deep thanks for the Super Chat as well there's no message with that did you mean to ask a question there let me check if you asked it in chat was it that one Rico L for Quan so uh if you've got .5 on the bank then yeah you can go to any 4.5 if you don't have anything in the bank then you can't cuz Quan has gone down so in terms of The Replacements I would say Robinson's my favorite cuz as we were saying earlier he's home to Leicester then he's away ipswitch home to West Ham not as good that one but Lewis I would say is very close behind because he's 4 and a half he was incredible gamei one and he's not really a defender of how he plays in the team but those that watch saw him I talked about in the expert video he peps like created a new role just for Lewis and that might have just been for one game that might be a new thing this season to try and phase Walker out he doesn't just invert into Midfield which is what you normally does with Defenders he was pushing up and playing in the attack like the front six so it was a 316 formation and attack and it was Lewis playing in that front six so he's like insanely Advanced so um yeah I think he's an awesome pick for 4 five uh but he's not nailed that's the risk that you will that you take on there you never know if walkon comes in at some point so it maybe it depends on the rashy defense as well if you've got that flexibility to you know be able to afford him benched and then just don't start him after that then go for him Walker just posted on his story I haven't seen what he's posted but that's what I'm saying he could come in at some point it might not be gamei 2 it could be gamei 3 cuz West Ham West Ham got some really Pacey players and that might suit Walker more than this week so what Lewis is the huge upside pick like huge but riskier Robinson's the safer one because he will start if that makes sense start Xiao Pedro or in kunu I'd give um Xiao Pedro the start he should play more minutes and he's on penalties and he's got him fixture North Bank G says G to start if not replace him with moon is you'd imagine he lines up with the same front three so d has J Salah so my my best guess is he doesn't start it's hard to say so early on but like they got the win without gakpo starting so you you'd think he probably goes with the same front three so yeah Darwin on the vent as well but you never know but yeah if I had him I'd sell him it's just too risky to hold him pick two or three to start from British guy Gabriel Robinson or am I'd start Gabriel and Robinson 400,000 people triple captain in Harland holy is that true it was 300,000 yesterday so that does line up oh yeah over 400,000 FPL managers are playing their triple Captain chip for game week two who's got their active it's going to be a game to hide behind the sofa like when City play I switch if you don't have harand 400k yesterday wow could be like half a million that's mental that's the other thing that's kind of appealing right now he's what 50ish percent owned by the time you use it in a double game later in the season harand could be in every team well not every team but you know it could be in 90% of really engaged managers teams by them so those points are shared among more managers so yeah there's pros and cons it's it's a really interesting one and it's um it's like new territory we've never been in this situation where they've changed the FA Cup schedule which means two expected double game weeks normally there's loads of double game weeks and a few blank game weeks as well so Eddie says he's hovered over it he's got his finger over it he's thinking about it he's like oh do I go for it so yeah it's uh it's unprecedented territory to have less double game weeks and we just don't know how it's going to play out in terms of when the chip should be used cuz what could easily happen is the bench boost is way better to use in one of those doubles and then in the other double the free hit might be better to use and also we can have up to five free transfers so when we get to the blank game week you might have four Ro transfers in the bank and you can just quite easily navigate the blank gaming now whereas in the the past you get to these blank game weeks and you've only got eight players that start for your team and you're looking at a minus8 to fill 11 this season it could be a totally different story where you've got I maybe it's like you're dreaming but it maybe it won't happen but if you can have like three four three transfers you could potentially much easier get out 11 players in the blank gaming which means the three hits better used in a double which means where does the triple Captain go maybe it should go right now maybe it should go I'm probably selling myself now on on it but they super tempting like 1.34 projected goals for Harland which is the highest or joint highest last season and this season yeah and the Mystery chip like as malbert says plus there's the mystery chip we don't even know what that is how it works whether that should be used in a double gaming like imagine the mystery chip is your Defenders score double I think it's something they did in FB challenge last season cuz last season they experimented with all sorts and FBO Challenge and we've seen them move some stuff across from FBO challenge to the main game so imagine if it's that Defenders score double Strikers score double like we saw that in challenge last season if that's what it is then I'm using that in the double game week I might even bench boost a single game like it's just a lot of unknowns right now so it's a risk and you making a decision without all the information which means you know there's potential for bigger Gam but there's also potential for that to be a bad call depending on how things play out but like I can't argue against it it's is genuinely a good option this week genuinely I'm not saying that to trick anyone like I've made the case for and against it and uh we did a poll earlier 25% had theirs active so yeah the F the vast majority aren't going for it but clearly there are a lot considering it in terms of the captain pole 73% Harland 19% Salah 3% Sun and 4% other interesting check if there's been any leaks nothing at the moment I'll keep checking in the background and those are harand six biggest tools ever all home games triple triple Captain Harland I just went on like a five minute rant about triple captain isand and like well not rant ramble it's it's definitely viable definitely salanki owners who's your replacement what are you doing with him let us know in chat who have you bought if you had salanki or are you just keeping him e captain no not for me I think there's better captains than e like harand Salah son Marco's gone vardy R's gone havit Thomas has gone wood virtual says finally decided on moon is good luck with the Moon is pick yeah moon is is a a good chout I would say I'd probably have him pratic says tell us your experience on the FPL show um yeah it's it's really cool so what happens is you you join on Zoom here we go you join on Zoom this is my first time actually chatting to Kelly Summers she's so lovely she's so nice she was like it's the first time we ever spoken Oscar and she was like it's lovely to meet you and all this and um yeah you're basically sitting there on zoom and they're doing their live recording live on TV and you're waiting for them to come to you so yeah I'm just sort of sitting there like listening to them watching on Zoom trying not to get stuck in my own head and try not to get nervous yeah and then eventually they come to you with the questions they do tell you in advance what they're going to ask you so you have a bit of like you have a chance to prepare for it so yeah then they come to you and they're like and we've got F focal joining us so yeah it's really cool goes on TV around the world uh it's on the Premier League YouTube channel as well if anyone wanted to watch it yeah Kelly and Sam are lovely so yeah it was a good experience really enjoyed it looks like you have a crash on there oh everyone's got a crash on Earth any man united team news uh no not as far as I've seen let me check if I've had any leaks don't think so no nothing at the moment what have I missed uh not too much really I mean I've added a new widget on the left hand side you know you know where it says experts captaincy it rotates in now you'll see it in a second and then it'll come up with team news so I've added that just to help people catch all the headlines from the game week I'll update that every game week that's new on the stream so there's some news there um is the tripier transfer confirmed I mean there's rumors he might leave and if that does happen liento by the way 4.5 mil be an absolute gem uh Connor Darlington says start Winks over sanki thoughts on a free transfer Kio rich charison I would I would use the free transfer get rid of sanki if I had him Connor I'd go to munes uh I think mateta is fine as well Armstrong from Southampton I'd buy one of those three think about it those picks have got way more upside than rolling and playing Winks Winks is going to get you two points isn't he realistically I say that he's probably going to score now but like Chase the upside if you got sanki and you've got a free transfer then I would move him on this week uh R Dragona says currently 25k fair play that's a mad game at one rank would you make any changes to this wild card team he's gone Trent viio porro Saka aen kungu jot Holland isak munes well yeah I wouldn't have in kungu I definitely wouldn't have in kungu if I'm honest I'd be very tempted to have Salah over har um Salah over sacka I would let's see if you can find a way to do that the reason being they're home to brenford they've got good fixtures obviously the next three you're Captain harand but then Game MC five harland's got Arsenal and Newcastle salah's got Bournemouth home Wolves Away so personally I'm I might try and find a way to have both and that as I was saying earlier that could be Xiao Pedro in for isach when Xiao Pedro is home to whip switch I think it is in G we four um or I could go Bruno down to a 55 like mte and then sacka to Salah would be the other move so I'm working towards that so personally if I was on a wild card I think I'd have both now but yeah it you'd have to rejig a few players there uh if you if you're happy with that as it is and you prefer that balance then the only one I changed there is Inu the rest is great just make sure you've got a rotation player for porro when he's got Newcastle and Arsenal you might be right playing him against Newcastle but Arsenal I'd want to have someone to start there like dunk who's home to Forest per Hanson says would moon is are Armstrong when already owning Smith row yeah I would go Moonis or Armstrong they're very very close I would say like Armstrong's on penalties he's home to is he home this week to Forest I think I think he's home to Forest this week they're very close it's hard to separate them because moon is has got two great fixtures and a better team I would go moonz personally it's very close xia Pedro and kungu St uh Xiao Pedro did you transfer for Canon no I just already had him I did have Jefferson but then they signed Evan nilson so I I figured there's no chance jebson really plays can's not going to play either to be honest but I just thought Dak is out for a while I thought vardy was out for a while but he turns out he wasn't but yeah I felt like maybe is the likeliest to get one point cameos I mean I'm in trouble if I ever have to go that deep on my bench it doesn't really mean much I just went for a lowend 4.5 forward 1.4% anyone have mub last season that was pain mub he was tearing it up in pre-season and it looked like he was going to be an impact sub and they didn't get used at all and he dropped to like 4.3 so I just thought it's not even worth it you you rarely go that deep in your bench run says I'm already that deep into my bench LW yeah I mean some people out there have been so unlucky like if you started with sanki bco K Quanza like that's that is so unlucky obviously some players wear risks like B could B was really good in preseason and expected to start game one at least you know after that who knows once the stance back but yeah Quan bit unlike like you didn't no one expected a halftime sub him we knew he could be a rotation risk and then obviously sank injury is the most unlucky of the three you needed ad doy to show parro up today it's not the question I had a dogy game it won last season and he got me like 12 points in like game week two or something that was that was one of the most stressful moments last season so I'd started last season with Gabrielle because I I missed out on that leak like loads of people had CRA instead so that was a painful start to the season but on top of that Gabriel was benched I think it was gamei 2 and I had a dogy on my bench who like he scored and he kept a clean sheet I think so he got like 12 points or 14 or something and I was watching the Arsenal game like oh my God please don't bring gabri on please cuz like that's one point versus like 14 and I got very lucky very very lucky cuz he Gabrielle didn't play that one and then ad DOI Auto subbed on uh we got what just under 20 minutes till deadline so I'll keep an eye out for any last minute leaks or news um obviously it's F and V man united uh sorry Brighton V man united first so that' be the one if anything we get something for but we might get some city news for 3:00 so stick around almost 3,000 so uh yeah thank you all for being here by the way appreciate you tuning into the deadline streams good to have you all joining us it's sank a must sell not an absolute must if you've got really good depth to just ride it out or if you've made a transfer already something like that but I would sell him if I had a free transfer yeah any chance quer starts I would say 25% is my best guess I've put them behind coner on my bench based on that um so I've gone yeah har and Captain e at vi just making sure everything's in the right order actually you know what I think I'm going to start bam Mar in gamei three just in case he gets the nod over flam like why not the worst that happens is flacking gets injured in the 80th minute and Val Marson gets a one point but Henderson's away at Chelsea so is barco's price now locked yeah he's locked now so yeah if anyone missed it he's gone to CIA on a season long loan a very early entry to FB folklore that one barely gameweek two and we've got uh baru he was like the fifth most popular Defender by far the most popular fourwh Defender and he's gone for the season and now he's red flagged so his price is locked at least uh Cory thanks for the Super Chat he uh says AR L Trent burn vardal Smith row and kungu Deo jot Bruno Armstrong eak triple Captain harand fleen Howard Bellis sber Winks anything you do differently with this lineup so it's just burn or CRA isn't it really what's the clean sheit odd say on that I'd be tempted to start CBE now Newcastle Arsenal 34 yeah I'd agree with that I'd start CBA um yeah good luck with the triple Captain by the way you're not the only one we did a poll earlier and like 25 we doing 25% we doing it Cory so yeah you're not the only one there um that's the only change I'd make and then I'd put burn ahead of Howard Bellis on your bench other than that looks good to go Astro X gaming says hi Oscar triple Captain Harland honest thoughts all right we'll do triple Captain one last time I think it's viable I'm not doing it but I think it's genuinely viable cuz we've got two expected doubles we got the bench boost the free hit and the triple Captain which are all good and doubles we've got the free hit which works in BL blanks as well but we do have up to five transfers which might get you for a blank game we easier than historically and then we got the mystery chip we don't know what that is so it might be the most effective weit to use a triple Captain cuz it's less power powerful than the bench boost and the free hit yeah I saw France going for it so like it's not it's not that crazy I don't hate it at all the other side of the coin is we might get an extra unexpected double uh you know gami 30 Harland home to Leicester so there is that option there to wait for another single gameing plus we know what the mystery chip is plus we know we have an idea of what the doubles are going to be so that's the arguments for and against so who's going for it are you triple Captain him no yes or no there's the poll experts captaincy uh as you can see 90% this week went Harland 8% Salah 1% foden and one went for Saka I think it was no early team news right now I'll keep an eye out because we're bound to get something near the deadline so the second we get anything I'll let you know and I'll put it in the bottom left corner of the screen yeah no City leaks at the moment I reckon we might get something near the deadline but you never know but yeah second me get anything bottom left corner that widget is leaks of players at starts and players that are benched so you'll always see it there during these streams as and when we get something reliable how we doing Jay is Mente going to play get a brighten Source focal well he's he's been clear to play he's fully fit so I I'd guess he probably does but might come off early for a ding gr who did well in gamei one as well where are you getting that Man United news from I've not seen anything yeah I mean there's uh yeah Walker's Instagram which does he know he's starting though oh they was simply United wasn't it that said g action XY both start I don't know how reliable they are though I remember last week they were right weren't they I don't know if it's a good source though so but they said gacho and xeri both start yeah they've only just started sharing team news to my knowledge well I didn't see them in any past Seasons anyway so I'd rather wait and see like that they're definitely reliable before I start including them but yeah they said uh they said that that gacho and xerx you both start should I captain vard or Katy B I'd go for s or harand if you've got either Harry but yeah I'd rather Captain ktie be captain and attacker rather than a Defender the risk with Defenders all it takes is one goal conceded and you're mudded and like and then you're really counting on an attack and return from a Defender which is way less likely isn't it captain isak or J between those two I'd say isak what should I do with Barco if you've got Barco and you don't need to play him this week just keep hold of him it's it's a waste of a transfer this early to sell four Defender unless you genuinely don't have a defense like if you picked a defense that has someone that's injured or you know maybe if you've got like Quan or Matson and Barco and you've got three Defenders that probably won't play that's the only circumstance I consider it but I'd sell one of the other ones first that are worth more money so just keep hold of him John says focal Ultras use a triple mark my words what I will say is John triple Captain Fulham last season and it was like game M four or something wasn't it John and he got hat-trick and an assist and I can't even begin to imagine how that must have felt John like 20 points in a single game triple Captain fair play and he's doing it again this week so will the John single Captain single will the will Jon's single game triple Captain streak continue find out this time next week fany says I follow John who follows John it is so tempting but I'm going to leave it reluctantly I'm going to leave it but God it is tempting like this week is the highest projected goals for a player we've had for the last two seasons 1.34 40% share of the goals which is the highest that harland's ever been uh yeah no leaks at the moment the only one was simply United but but yeah I can't vouch for their reliability so I'd be reluctant to like recommend their news but I'm going to keep an eye I'm refreshing in the background John the Baptist uh yeah no leaks at the moment we've got eight minutes till deadline so I'll keep an eye out for anything we get 10 hog starts if we get anything before the deadline I'll update bottom left corner straight away but all we've had so far is simply United but I can't vouch for their reliability last week was the first time I ever saw them they do have 71k followers but that doesn't mean they're 100% reliable so I'll keep refreshing though the referee Stars anyone got referee I think I'll bench him best 4.5 Defender for long term if you need to start them this week then uh I'd say Robinson I like I quite like dunk but you can't really start him for the next two I switch home Forest Home there wolves there um other ones like Lewis you wouldn't say a long term would you they're just they're risky start coell or in kungu thanks for that Charlie Smith I would start in kungu he um he played what 58 minutes in the Europa conference League which I think points towards another start getting his Fitness up and all that what is rmts and FPL that means rate my team yeah if anyone's not in the focal Discord there's a rate my team Channel um I'll spam the link to join in the chat if anyone's not in there we've got like 13,000 members so if you got Discord that's the link to join it's in the description as well um the mini league code is down there as well I always forget to plug it but the uh yeah the mini leaks in the description as well uh and my Tik Tok and Instagram as well if you want to follow me there yeah I'm good thanks as home zic says says good luck to everybody not long now what 5 minutes I'll take a screenshot of my team now anyway cuz I'm rolling let's stick that on uh on Twitter game week 2 there we go so yeah har and Captain eak BCE done um official iron said thanks for the 16 months says Captain son or kdb also start G nacho or moones do you not have harand or Salah I'd rather either of those to those two but if you don't have them I'd say son I mean these for for the last time in the Stream we'll have a quick look at the projected points this week and um Sun's in third actually on FP review Everton have got brand fight out young suspended Coleman and Patterson out taros is a major doubt I think Sun makes a lot of sense even though he wasn't incredible gamei one I'd say um son between those two I'd start Moonis as well I think that's close but I'd say mois over Garo if I was picking one to start H mkey says people are sleeping on Moma yeah I mean he was an absolute Beast wasn't he a couple of years ago I think people are waiting for gamei 4 cuz like I can see him being popular here y switch home Forest Home uh any latest team news just there's the team news widger on the left hand side that rotates him that's got kind of the headlines um and if we get any leaks then that'll go in the widget below that but nothing we've not had anything I mean the problem is like City play at 3:00 so it's difficult when they're later we often get Liverpool leaks but they literally play the last game tomorrow so that's the other reason Howard bis or winks um difficult one that nothing between them Howard Bellis I'd say he's got the home fixture they probably both get two you got the allergies again it just like messes my throat up I think talking for two straight hours starts to hurt after like 2 hours I long just sit here in dead silence editing videos so like to suddenly talk for two straight hours so yeah if anyone's just joined I'm I'm rolling the transfer um we've not had any leaks for those that are asking about leaks three minutes till deadline what did everyone do this week did you roll a transfer did you make a transfer who did you buy Henderson or Sanchez the start Palace 29% chance of a clean sheet Chelsea 34 Sanchez lots of you rolled lot sank owners sank up moon is in sank to moon is Matthew says get focal to 200k

FPL videos so why not you haven't got YouTube account then make a YouTube account that's also free and then you get the videos in your YouTube feed every week as and when they upload straight away triple Captain earling I thought that said triple Captain Sterling I was like are you mad yeah triple Captain erling a lot of triple captains this week seemingly I wonder what the final number is I reckon it could be like a million a million triple captains maybe that's a bit of an overestimate what that be like one in 10 managers now that seems about right I think thanks very much Thomas so yeah no early team news or leaks but yeah like City you've got the 3:00 so it was always uh unlikely for that one and Liverpool play 3 uh 5:30 tomorrow so that's my team I rolled the transfer this week harand Captain obviously uh isak Vice here for f bench one Robertson or Muno Muno you're too late I think but Muno do it quick you got like 10 seconds my god Kobe says I beg son bags of brace they really they really should put Everton away when they're missing five Defenders they really should but they should have put Lester away and didn't so Thomas says wish wished I rolled the try for a bloody slot on Quan so yeah this is uh what I did for f challenge by the way that's the uh that's the deadline Campbell MB says deadline that's a wrap says hampo FPL baitman locked good luck guys says

37,FPLFocal,ZU_lXyB2Ckw,FINAL FPL TIPS | GW2 | SOLANKE INJURED ⚠️,2024-08-23T13:02:44Z,"welcome back for another video I asked for all the biggest FBO questions and dilemmas this week which we're going to go through plus we're going to react to the latest press conference news from today if you like your question answered in the Future video just make sure you subscribe and you'll see a post in your YouTube feed every week goon is fpo ask for opinions on vanderberg as a potential formal starting Defender for brenford and he mentions that fixed your on from gami 6 now we've got the benefit of been able to wait four weeks so we can just assess his minutes to be honest it is an odd one cuz 25 mils a lot of money to spend and they've got Collins and Pinner as first choice center backs ready with Frank sometimes switch into a back three against tougher oppositions for more defensive solidity and this is when a third Center back comes in which can be Aya or me so there's a lot of competition now last season he played center back only but he has played in right back and right wing back a bit before so perhaps that's an option where he'll be used if you're a Barco owner don't rush to replace him with another 4 mil barco is going to be price locked once he's flagged anyway for his loan so you're not exposed to a price fall in a nutshell don't buy him now wait and see he'll be an awesome pick in gamei six if he's starting regularly before then FPL fly asked whether we should have both Harland and Salah which would take an early wild cut to do right now for a minus four hit minimum he also ask if everyone else should be an enabler to allow this strategy now this is just one man's opinion but I wouldn't wild cut after one week purely to get both in there's so much information to be changed completely by gamei 3 there's so much information to be gain in the early weeks every season and it's genuinely possible the picture could completely change by Game 3 what I also say say is it is possible to get both without a wild card I'll use my team as an example here on plan FPL if I go forward to gamic four where hopefully I'll have two fre transfers Bruno to M and Saka to Salah Works in two moves with a bit spare in the bank as well and it still has a couple of big hitters in Trent and isach however Bruno does have Southampton gaming four so what about another route Isa toia Pedro or some other 5 and a half mil Works Brighton have got I switch in the forest home back to back which is why I've used that as a solid example for M and Jiao Pedro and that allows sacka to Salah as well and it keeps Bruno for Man United against Southampton obviously by waiting you do miss out on a couple of fixtures for Salah but once you've got him you've got him as a captain option for Bournemouth and walls when harland's got Arsenal in Newcastle and that's the other appeal to picking up Salah in gaming four or5 by the way use the link below to become a scout member of a 40% discount you get plan Foo premium chucked in along with all the Scout members tools and awardwinning articles of course if you manage to have three free triers by then you'll have even more flexibility the key thing is obviously to nail those enabl when you've got 272 mil spent on two players and again going back to the earlier point with more weeks of information it'll be clear who the best cheap players are to own and I'm not expecting another Palmer to come along but you never know who the next Big Valley pick is big update from Spurs next so first of all POA Cog confirmed Pedro por is fine so good news if you've got him he's fit to play gami 2 and he was spotted in training with the squad yesterday however he's also confirmed that sank is out for gameing 2 this was the full quote Dom picked up a knock in the last game he got got through the game but it flared up the day after and he'll miss the game tomorrow it's an ankle injury he copped it really early on someone went across his ankle and it just depends on his recovery when he returns obviously we've got the international break but it's not serious so the good news is is not serious but the fact he alluded to the international break suggests it could be more than one game week after gamei 3 we do have the weekend off before gamei 4 so he's probably a cell annoyingly for those of you that got him who are the best Replacements then well hav has just risen 0.1 1 mil so he's 8.1 mil so unless you've got 1 mil in the bank he's Out Of Reach if you do have 1 mil then go for havs who else outside of havs then the two that I would consider are Mata and munes both we got decent fixtures now Mata came off early last match but he did play all summer at the Olympics he's home to West Ham gamei 3 then Chelsea away then Leicester home the other one's munis who's home to Leicester this week and then IP switch away and then West Ham he is a bit out of form to be honest but the features are there it's not totally out the question for himz to get some maybe even a start at some point but it's pretty slim pickings the last one I'd look at is Armstrong he's only 5 1 half mil the cheapest one he's home to Forest this week and then he's got brenford away man united home and then IP switch home drop a comment below what you're doing with salanki root course ask triple captain or not to Triple captain that is the question let's do a deeper dive into triple captain and Chip strategy so this season there's two expected double game weeks the bench boost free hit and triple Captain are all good in double game weeks so that's three three chips for two double game weeks however the free hits also good in blank game weeks and then we've got the mystery chip which is unknown we don't know how it works or when's best to use it my gut feeling is it's not going to be a double gami oriented chip it could be something like a single gami Defenders or forward score double points but that's guess work since there's less doubles logically it wouldn't make any sense for them to throw another double gam chip in so with that all said it could be one of the most effective weeks to use the triple Captain Harland home to whip switch but you are taking a chance at the bench boost and the free hit are best using double gamix later and what's also worth mentioning is we could of course have up to five free transfers now so it is possible to get a blank gamei with lots blanked and it' be much easier to navigate them now harand doesn't have midweek football at the moment either he's had the summer off and he's saying he's never felt better so I honestly don't hate it but personally I'm planning to keep hold of it if you do go for it best of luck it's certainly an opportunity and if harand bangs and his ownership's going to fly up by the time we get to double gami 34 wherever it's going to be we could have basically the entire game Triple cap in Harem by then with minimal gains to be had of course in that hypothetical scenario if you use it now then you'll lose rank for every Harem point he gets in the double game week yay asks about a s to foden move in isolation foden looks a great transfer this week really low ownership considering but the only players that really get you there are son sacka Palmer Salah and I personally wouldn't sell any of them for him Everton have got bran for injured young suspended and then Coleman and Patterson also injured in right back and now taros could miss the the game of an injury as well the way it Spurs so that feels like a sideways move at best and is it ever worth making a trle where you look at it and think the player I'm selling could definitely outscore who I'm buying here son has Newcastle and Arsenal game three and four that's when I'd be looking to sell him if I had him Anthony KN goldon asks is Watkins still worth keeping now he didn't have a great gami one literally not. not expected goal involvement not that surprising without a single preseason minute played and then to add to that they've got the best defense in the league last season in Arsenal next home fixture the thing is though if you look at Villa's fixtures from game three onwards you'd be selling a player that a lot of people are going to be looking to buy from gamei 3 they've got Lester Everton wolves and IP switch which is an insane block of four fixtures so if I had Watkins as frustrating as it is after the blank and then faing Arsenal I'd keep hold of him all it takes really is a poor eak match in game week 2 and millions of those owners are going to be asking where it's worth to swap him for Watkins hypothetically if half of my team get injured in game week 2 and I have to walk out game week three personally I'd 100% have Watkins in my team WS Su asks isn't kungu a cell or not now the only circumstance I'd consider selling really is if I had 0.5 mil to swap him straight to e otherwise I'd give him one more week now Chelsea played on Thursday night in Europa conference league and this was the lineup he did start and he's off at 58 minutes which I think has got to be of aiew to start in in gameweek 2 against walls and he won a penalty while he's on the pitch which he took himself and he scored Palmer wasn't on the pitch at that time who we do expect on penalty still clearly there is a risk of him coming off early every game but I'd get another week of information before sell him there could be another 6 and a half mil or even a 5 and a half in midfielder that emerges as the clear favorite to own right now it's not that clear and by the way after that Europa conference game Palmer was seen Winson as he came off down the tunnel at full time but moresa said he felt something but he looks fine they already checked him and he looks fine and okay hopefully there's no problem and he can be available for Sunday's game the last bit of news and good news if you do have Inu is moresa said the following on Netto the last time he played 90 was in February a long time ago we need him and seven or eight more players to also build the physical condition probably to give him another game on Sunday is too early but we'll see let's talk about quansa then off a halftime game at won a price fall to 4.4 mil and this morning slot said I spoke to him immediately after the game and on Sunday on Tuesday he picked up a bit of an injury so let's see if he can train today I just said that he lost one or two important Jews so it looks like he's even less likely to get another start now and the problem here is if you've got nothing in the bank the only way you can go for free transfer is down to a four Defender and none really leap out this week if you've literally got a barebone defense with only like two starters at the back then I'd say it's worth selling him for a Howard Bellis who at least has got home fixed to Forest if you've got an 0.5 mil in the bank then there's lots more options you could look at a 4.5 mil Defender like Robinson or R Lewis Lewis is the risky pick but huge upside some other news to be aware of from today so taros is are doubt to face Spurs bran white Coleman Patterson Garner all remain out and then young suspended as well so keep faith in your Spurs picks no injury concerns for Newcastle ahead of game 2 how saying pretty much as we were now Sher serves the first of his three match suspension and he says trippy is trained as normal despite transfer speculation botman lels tanali Marley and Wilson all remain out finishing up with my final team then and thoughts this week I've got Henderson in goal Trent Don compar in defense and K sacka a Bruno and Smith row Midfield isak and Harland up top I had been waying up giving Quan for a star but it just feels too risky after the comments about his injury and hoping that he'll train today so I decided to ride out the quanta prise for very annoying but that's how it goes sometimes and I'll hopefully use a spare fre triers on a more exciting move in game week three or four like we mentioned earlier in FPL fly segment having both s and Harland does look solid and it's something I'm going to work towards with gamei 4 possibly something else I've considered is Bruno to foden in gamei 3 when know got Liverpool and then inku to a 5 and a half mon midfielder to fund it this gives me harand sack and fodm the downside is no way to get to Salah really and captaincy in gamei 5 and six would have to be Harland against Arsenal and Newcastle I like both RS so let's see what gamei 2 brings

39,FPLFocal,jB7MQDe3nEg,FPL GW2 EXPERTS TEAM | TRIPLE CAPTAIN ACTIVE!,2024-08-22T10:44:42Z,"welcome back for another video we're back with the gamei 2 edition of the experts we've got data from hundreds of top alltime managers again this week and as you probably guessed from the video title it's an interesting one this week was some triple Captain chips active so lots to discuss and if you are new around here make sure you're subscribing so you don't miss out these weekly tips the managers involved in this series have finished top 100 in the world four times 44 top 1K finishes and 367 top 10K finishes starting off with the manager highlight and if you recall from last week we had a few bench boosts using game one Oscar was the one we actually highlighted and he finished on 104 points the first rank of the Season being 1.3k now it wasn't actually the most successful bench boost with seven points though an interesting thought experiment is would he have picked the same start in 11 if not using the chip 97 points from the starting 11 is outrageous in his own right honorable mention to Steven hinchy as well who's another one that used the bench boost with a more successful bench scoring 22 points he'd be happy with that in the double gami even and he finished on 90 points we're going to talk more on double gamic later in this video and why some top managers are experimenting with chips more than ever the average score in the experts League was 65 points so about eight more than a global average moving on to transfer activity this week the vast majority are rolled in the transfer to take two into game 3 73% rolling 26% are spending their free transfer and one manager is making two transfers for a minus four no wild cards or free hits active this week in game week to which is good news they haven't gone completely off the rails with the chips yet so which players are they buying and selling their top transfer in is Robinson who 12% have picked up and avoided the qu of priz fall he is the most sold player 22% have got rid of him if you've still got Quanza and nothing in the bank then sitting tight is probably the sensible play as there's no four Mill Defenders with enough upside gami to Howard bis is the only one I can think of who might work giving the home to Forest but you'd like to think saving a transfer now lets you make a move of much more upside in gamei three than Harvard Bellis now for example foden in game 3 looks good or Salah in game 4 if you don't have either of those both are possible path to look out of your teams 4% of B Lewis who did impress in gami one kept a clean sheet against Chelsea I watched an interesting video from 442 which I'll link below analyzing his role gamei one peps almost invented a new role for L seemingly so peps always used inverted fullbacks for years so one of the fullbacks always pushes up and Tucks into Midfield the example here is you'd expect Lewis to invert circled in red and this creates a box in Midfield which forms passing triangles he's used this for years though and there are ways to prepare for it and negate it instead we saw Lewis playing as part of the front six yeah the front six so 316 formation in attack it sounds Bonkers but that's how City played against Chelsea at times and Le circled in red here joining that front six as a result he kept popping up in Crazy Advanced areas it is an incredibly demanding role to play though he is capable of playing it we'll have to see if it continues so it's surely too good to be true for 4 and a half mil well yeah probably cuz Walker's in the picture and pep could call on him at any point and in honesty a start in the next two games wouldn't surprise me maybe G me three rather than game week 2 however the upside is undeniable and by the way it is the same way that POA Cog uses Pedro POR in a dogy all this analysis for City to win 5-1 and Le to get a two-pointer so who are some other notable names on the list one manager has sold Bruno for foden who is a bit of a crazy differential at this stage especially among engaged managers in fact the one that's brought him in even captained him I'm surprised to see salanki sold or be it just one manager hit's coming in for them fun fact havit has actually got the most open Play Goals and assist in the Premier League this calendar year he's an absolute lock for me from game six Arsenal got difficult fixtures in the interim but he could absolutely deliver still and artetta has clearly got intent to use him as a striker this season with the possible arrival of Marino a quick look at chip users then so we saw 2% use their bench boost in game one the appeal there was you're essentially wild carding straight into the bench boost which you can't do during the season and there are going to be less double gamix this season though we also saw with bco it can go wrong now 3% have got their triple captain ship active this week FBO addict is one of those his last four finishes are 28k 7.5k 2.3k and 16k so on average just outside the top 10K and here's his team for this week it's fleen Pedro porro Gabrielle CA Robinson and kungu sacka J salanki harand and isak I asked him about the decision here's what you had to say whenever considering a chip I think about the fixtures information available and where the chip fits into my wider strategy so fixtures Liverpool put up 2. 56 expected goals against ipswitch in the second half after slot Chang the system it's hard not to imagine pep not exploiting their vulnerabilities with Rob tfpl projecting City to put up 3.3 expected goals and giving IP switch just a 4% chance of a clean sheet information post Chelsea harand claimed he's never felt better after a full pre-season and no Euros he should be sharp with Alvarez gone no mid week fixure to prepare for and plenty of time to recover Holland's expected minutes are unlikely to be higher than now strategy triple captains a relatively low cealing chip compared to the bench boost free hit and possibly the mystery Shar given we likely only have two double gamic this season it makes playing the triple captain in a single gamei more attractive is there a better opportunity than nip switcher home some seem nervous about using the chip early in the season seemingly for the sake of it fp's about taking calculated risks with imperfect information this is the one I'm likely to take best of luck whatever you choose and he also said I also think the 53 trif rule could potentially cover chips in the blank game weeks and unexpected double game wees with good planning this would boost the value of the triple captain in a single game Meek thanks for sharing markers appreciate the write up and best of luck if you do stick with it moving on to expert's captaincy and as you can imagine it's really lopsided this week it's Harland top Captain by 90% And then Sal of 8% sacka 1% pH and 1% there's not much to think about if you own Harlem this was the chart that F addict mentioned earlier from Rob tfpl was sitting on 3.3 projected goals Liverpool with 2.95 five projected goals so Sal is still a very sound Captain FP reviews latest projections have got Holland on 8.9 points Salah 8.1 s on third by the way of 6.4 which Su just given him one more week despite the blank gami one and Palmer in fourth now a haul from him would really make things very interesting given Chelsea's upcoming games best a luot with captaincy this week everyone let us know who you're going with in fact let us know if you're thinking about triple Captain as well I have to say FPL adex pitch was very good moving on to the experts team and if his video has been useful don't forget to like the video and make sure you're subscribing we're 98% there to 200,000 the team this week is Henderson in goal Trent Pedro por Robinson at the back and kungu sacka E joton Smith roow midfield harand captain alongside isach Val de Marson Hall xia Pedro and Barker on the bench so quansa drops out the team and in comes Hall who's got her ownership now now The Season's underway we've got the ownership percentages among all the experts teams every week which I pull up now so we've got the overall ownership we've also got the difference which is useful spot in those players the experts really like that the overall player base aren't considering so for example isak's 100% owned 58% overall Trent is 69% owned 31 overall just note the experts ownership percentages are from the previous gaming as it's really hard to project those accurately Robinson 55% own just 10% overall and Sal is the only player here with a negative difference in 27% of their teams but 36% overall now it didn't go amazingly in game one but if sh didn't get that red card and isach hold he was the Captain for pretty much all the Salah non-owners it could have really changed the picture this week it's Salah versus Harland will it swing back the Harland owners way very solid team this week let's see how they get on on to the experts final thoughts and tips for gamei 2 here's what they had to say this week Lee Coffield says with two foral Defenders on the bench and a potential price f for quansa have been forced into an early move Robinson feels like the safest replacement longer term Benny M9 says with there being less double gamix this season it might be a good decision to use a triple captain on harand if EV is there I'll wait on the markets to update prior to making the decision Guido says plan is to save a transfer in gami 30 I can do por and salanki to Alexander Arnold and shiao Pedro for their double home fixtures in gamei four and five this coincides with when Spurs play Arsenal gamei four mayik says I'll try to avoid any knej reaction this week it's easy to panic after gamei one but I will keep faith in the squad I assembled not just for one week quansa is the obvious Warrior and he'll likely to be moved on in the coming weeks if he doesn't regain his spot this week or next next I have cover for the backline I'm not worried about the price drop making decisions just based on value loss is not good I prefer to get at least one more week of information before I make any changes after all next week there might be more important changes to make FPL sis also has his triple Captain active and he says Harland is the obvious Captain but the Dilemma is on the triple Captain he's at home versus a newly promoted side following the four preseason with no European commitment it's a go for me and lastly one from AAL man which I won't read out actually uh thanks very much for watching see you soon for the next one don't forget to subscribe for more FBO content to come before the deadline",1998
